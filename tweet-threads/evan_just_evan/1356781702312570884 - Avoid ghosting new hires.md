- Possibly,
  - But it's not fair - and it's a success despite management, not because of management.
  - If they don't have the capacity to be checking in regularly - having a good buddy/onboarding system and regular check-in points to see how things are going are important. [twitter.com/kefimochi/statâ€¦](https://twitter.com/kefimochi/status/1356774215001640962)
- Especially with many companies being remote right now - the "hey, look - someone new!" way of networking, meeting people, etc doesn't happen as naturally as it used to.
- If management is ghosting the new hire, and the new hire ends up succeeding - it's part luck and probably part great support from others on the team.
  - If you've joined an agency/services company - and not on a team and a 'free agent', and no support network .... ouf
- This is an area I'm still working at improving on, and been on my mind a lot recently.
  - Even if it's not daily meetings - still regular/daily contact through team meetings, available on slack, connecting them with other people, etc.
- But if they are getting ghosted, what I would then expect to see happen is
  - jr quits, or gets let go for underperforming (not their fault)
  -  manager gets it in their head "we can't hire/don't have the capacity for juniors"
  - relies heavily on int/sr hires
- Regardless of experience - it's still a crummy thing to do.
  - Someone with more experience is a bit more likely to survive the "sink or swim" approach,  but regardless of who your tossing into the deep end - it's no way to show that you care.
