* During standup today - someone mentioned that it would be sunny and above zero this afternoon.
  * Encouraged the team to take the time to get outside and some sun if they were able to, and moved around a few meetings to help make it a bit more possible. [twitter.com/evan_just_evanâ€¦](https://twitter.com/evan_just_evan/status/1357043399757561863)

* Was nice to see a bunch of messages popping up around lunch/early afternoon of people going out for a walk, to walk their dogs, etc and enjoy the fresh air.
  * Nice thing about getting out mid-day on a workday - less people outside in general, and easier to keep a safe distance.
