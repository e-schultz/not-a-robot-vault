- Having people split 50/50 between two different things is never 50/50
  It's more like 30/30 - with 40% dealing with context switching 
  YMMV depending on how related the things are, and how frequently you need to context shift.
    - **Note:** Save
- People often try to recommend time blocking so you only works on one thing part of the week, and on the other thing the rest of the week.
  ðŸ˜‚ - then added on 20% of defending your calendar and schedule management time.
- Having multiple responsibilities is common, and isn't always bad
  But we need to be more realistic that 50/50 has a bigger impact on the capacity for both things.
- Often - the split responsibility isn't communicated to others very well 
  And you have the expectations of 100% capacity from other people.
  Toss in the ad-hoc "can I grabbed you for a quickly min", and "can you do this - it should only take a second"
