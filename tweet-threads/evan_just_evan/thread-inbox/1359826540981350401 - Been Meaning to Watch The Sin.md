- Been meaning to watch this.
  But, I'm #HIV+ , open about it and proud.
  Proud that I didn't let it destroy me.
  Proud that I've overcome the shame and guilt.
  Proud that I have not let it define me.
  Proud that I've stopped playing the blame game.

    - **Note:** [[HIV and proud]]
- The idea of being HIV+ and proud used to confidence me when I was first diagnosed.
  I misunderstood the sentiment behind it 
  - that I thought people were proud to be HIV+ 
  - why the hell are you proud to have a virus?
  I'd wonder to myself.
- I get it now though 
  - I'm proud to live my life, work, play, love and be loved, 
  - to fight against the stigma, 
  to take care of my health while being HIV+
  I'm proud to be a notorious faggot, to be queer - and not hide who I am and diminish myself.
- I'm proud that when not once, but twice when people tried to blackmail me and threaten to disclose my status without my consent that I said 
  fuck you and didn't give into fear and manipulation.
- It took me awhile until i was fully honest about it, and for along time considered it "public knowledge to everyone except my family"
  The second person that tried to use my status against me knew that and threatened to tell them.
- I beat them to the punch, did it on my own terms - and they were amazing and supportive.
  For so long I had been wanting to rip off that final Bandaid, I had been HIV+ for years, on treatment, and doing fine - but there never seems to be a good time to break news like that.
- Glad I did.
  HIV+ are around you every day - coworkers, friends, peers - and you might not know it.
  So many people still assume you can tell by how people look.
  That look, is largely side effects of earlier medication treatments.
