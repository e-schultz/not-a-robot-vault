### Highlights first exported February 10, 2021 at 8:28 PM

- I have a bunch of stuff integrated with readwise.
  And readwise integrated with a few note apps.
  I tend to highlight and comment alot when I read (https://t.co/jp2O6TD3TC, instapaper, kindle, etc)
    - **Note:** Save [[beautiful distributed mess]]
- Kinda forgot I had that setup, as I haven't been intentionally working on writing / journaling the last while.
  Stating back up - so many notes on notes on notes.
  Especially when I'm highlighting and adding comments with [[backlinks]] etc
- If you think I info dump in public alot - you should see my digital brains and vaults ðŸ˜‚
  Starting to get stuff into zotero to make keeping track of citations / etc better.
- My ðŸ§  is a beautiful distributed mess
