- Seems like a lot of the books/articles about leadership, management, feedback, etc - are very neurotypical in perspective, and also the type of advice they give.
  - Most of them don't mention disability at all, but might talk about the importance of mental health
- "Bring  your whole self to work"
  - .... "the neurotypical parts"
  - Are there people at work giving feedback that someone doesn't seem that interested in the project because they are drawing in their notebook during meetings?
- Is someone's stutter going to get them disqualified from an interview because they are worried about communication skills? or read it as not being confident in their answers.
- Are there well-intentioned people saying "if you only tried a little bit harder, you'd really start getting ahead here",
  - aka - "have you tried trying?"
- Reading through ND twitter - so many people are not comfortable about being open about ADHD/etc at work for fear of how it will impact them at work.
- If there is someone that seems:
  - lazy
  - distracted in meetings
  - keeps making simple mistakes
  - doesn't speak up
  - How do you approach that?
  - How often does the feed back end up being
  - "try speaking up more",
  - without any consideration for maybe why they are not speaking up.
- is there leadership/management / etc content out there like that and I'm just missing it?
- Even thinking about things like
  - career goals
  - growth plans/road maps
  - how we approach training and education
  - It feels like it's trying to replicate like an academic path with courses and credits along the way, maybe with a few electives
