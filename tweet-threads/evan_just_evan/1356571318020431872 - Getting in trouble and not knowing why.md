- Great thread on how the expectations of what good behaviour can mean to a ND child, and adults.
  - Even when we think we are only our best behaviour - we get messages that we are not, and being disruptive.

- I remember in school - often getting in trouble, and not being sure why.
  - I wasn't the class clown,
  - I wasn't the bully,
  - I wasn't trying to be distracting to others.
  - But getting yelled at by teachers and told to go sit in the corner was a pretty common occurance.

- As an adult, and also talking more about it with my mom - a common reason was:
  - They thought that I wasn't paying attention.
  - When they raised thier voices - and eventually yelled at me, then I'd shut down - and then really not hear them.

- When a teacher yells at you, and you don't respond - ooh they don't like that.
  - Toss in a stutter that made you the target of teasing and bullying, you quickly learn that being good is being quiet, and making yourself small.

- A good day at school for me
  - Was a day where I didn't get noticed. ^022fa2
  - Fidgeting is distracting
  - drawing is distracting
  - asking took many questions is distracting


- We are told to raise or hands or goto the teacher if we are stuck and need help.
  - But then get comments on our report cards
  - has difficulty following instructions
  - needs to be reminded to stay on task
  - needs a instructions repeated
  - asks the same questions

- Ok, asking for help is bad.
  - doesn't ask for help when stuck
  - doesn't show thier work
  - makes simple mistakes
  - doesn't understand instructions
  - don't understand questions
  - Very conflicting feedback to be getting - especially when your neurodiverse and don't know it.

- The ways that I paid attention - the teachers didn't recgonize, and thought I wasn't paying attention.
  - When hands down eyes up - so focuses on paying attention, that I didn't hear what the teacher was saying.
  - But hey - I looked like I was paying attention.

- When your neurodiverse, and bullied for stuttering and being gay.
  - Getting in trouble and bullied for simply existing and about things that you don't understand - and can't change.
  - Becoming invisible can feel like the next best option.

- Eventually you learn to mask I guess.
  - In high school I lucked out and got a few good teachers that let me be me, and became pockets of safe space - during, and outside of class.

- When I think about Patty, and Ms. Mayberry, I get a bit teary eyed.
  - Ms Mayberry with her long orange hair, would crawl ontop of her desk during English and sit cross legged as she taught.
  - I'd talk with her during lunch and spares that I had.

- She also taught a graphic design class - I rarely did the assignment as assigned, and end up getting lost doing things that she didn't understand - but was impressed with what I did that I'd still get good grades
  - (a few exceptions here and there - which is fair)

- The teachers that didn't make me feel broken just for being me.
  - That were curious, and encouraged me in the ways that I worked.
  - Would  let me wander off in my own direction,
  - Then gently nudge me back on track.

- But - that was luck - I could have just as easily gone to a different highschool, or not ended up in thier classes.
  - And still - the overarching theme was to be good, was to not be noticed.
