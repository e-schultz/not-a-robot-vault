### Highlights first exported [[2021-02-10|February 10]], 2021 at 8:38 AM

- I was asked this weekend how I feel about "Google Warriors" that I may encounter in my medical practice. My mind immediately flashed to the "don't confuse your Google search with my medical degree" signs and the clever response that many disabled and chronically ill folks give:
    - **Note:** Save
- "don't confuse your medical degree with my X years living with my condition." 
  Now, not every patient who comes in with a ready Google search will be disabled or chronically ill -- although they often are.
- But, no matter what field of medical care you are in, it is so critical to remember the many reasons patients turn to Google. 
  Medical mistrust from years of racist, ableist, queerphobic, transphobic and sexist practice. 
  Inaccessibility of medical care (financial and other).
- Fear. Of what it may be, of what this may cost, of how it may impact family, friends, and self. Of medicine itself. 
  Empowerment. Physicians often make patients feel small, stupid, silly. Coming in with information can feel powerful.
- Family history. "Is there any chance this disease will take me now too?"
  And inevitably so many I can't even predict to list here.
- As doctors, we are one member of the team. The patient themselves, their family and friends, other caregivers, are equal -- if not bigger -- parts of the team.
- If we take the time to ask "what were you afraid of as you were Googling?" "What did you see that you have questions about?" "What are you hoping we rule out?" your patient will know you value them. Their perspective. Their emotions. Their LIFE.
- Getting a medical degree is a privilege. It does not make us better than. It gives us access to knowledge that should be paired with our patient's own understanding of their body, their feelings and fears, and their goals for their own lives. We must respect that.
- As a disabled future doctor, I can tell you, Google enabled me to fight for myself in the doctor's office long before I had the knowledge I do now.
