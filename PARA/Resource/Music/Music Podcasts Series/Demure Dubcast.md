# Demure Circle
##### About
Demure Circle is an electronic music and art collective based in San Francisco.

Community. Intention. Expression. Sincerity.

At the center of Demure Circle is a community building sincere connections through art. Weâ€™re removing the barriers of pretension and ego disconnecting us from the experience of each other, music, dancing, and life. We are people finding ourselves through the art of life, or a life of art. Our narratives are told through the music we play and stories we paint.
