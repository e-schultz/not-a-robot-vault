# Collaborative Learning 101: the 360 Learning Suite
**Right now, L&D teams around the world are facing a crisis of learning.** 

This is about more than just COVID-19 and going remote. We’re all struggling to find the time to finish our to-do lists. It’s no wonder the average course completion rate is just 20-30%. 

Despite these challenges, people still want to learn, and your experts still have knowledge to share. At 360Learning, we’re on a mission to make it easy to **ship and improve learning courses.**

That’s why we’ve built our Collaborative Learning platform. And now, in our new monthly event series, we’re here to tell you all about it! 

In this 30-minute demonstration with our learning specialist, you’ll learn how forward-thinking L&D teams engage and inspire learners.

Register now for our next session!

This will be a small group session to allow you to ask questions. You’ll learn how to:
- Help experts create and launch their first course in just 11 minutes
- Drive course completion rates of over 90%
- Save thousands in budget in annual training and cut onboarding time in half 
- Inspire your learners to complete an average of 11 activities per day

More than 1,200 training teams have transformed their learning culture with our platform. Come and hear more about how we’re helping organizations around the world learn and grow together.
