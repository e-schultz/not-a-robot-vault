# ðŸ“¹ Leveraging the Superpowers of Your Employees

##### Description
Each of your employees has a unique set of superpowers. How your team succeeds depends on how all those collective strengths are understood, balanced, and expressed.

In this webinar, positive psychology and people experts join forces to share tactics on spotting and leveraging individual strengths throughout the entire employee lifecycle. Whether youâ€™re experiencing a specific challenge or looking to redesign your entire HR system, everyone can benefit from improving team collaboration, understanding each otherâ€™s needs and contributions, and applying individual talents as strengths.

You will learn...
- Identifying tools, i.e. VIA and Gallup, that are effective at spotting employee strengths.
- Designing an HR system and job crafting to prioritize employee strengths.
- Utilizing strengths-based leadership practices in day-to-day performance management, recognition, and succession planning.
