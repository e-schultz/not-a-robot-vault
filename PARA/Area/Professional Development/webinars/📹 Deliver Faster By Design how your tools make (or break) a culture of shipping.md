# ðŸ“¹ Deliver: Faster By Design how your tools make (or break) a culture of shipping
- [[Professional Development MOC]] | [[JavaScript Frameworks MoC]]

##### Description
The headless approach has taken the digital marketing and e-commerce landscape by storm. This is due to the efficiencies gained by front-end JavaScript frameworks and the benefits of clean content that can be consumed from multiple devices and channels.

Headless however comes with its own challenges and many companies are falling behind when it comes to enabling marketing and development teams equally well.

Join our upcoming fireside chat on May 6th at 11:30am PDT / 2:30pm EDT with Jason Lengstorf, VP of Developer Experience at [[Netlify]] and Christopher Zimmerman, Product Manager, and Sandra Schroeter, Technical Product Marketing at Magnolia, to learn how to increase your teamsâ€™ collaboration and speed up experience delivery with the Jamstack.

During the chat, you will learn:

* How Magnolia overcomes challenges arising for content authors from a pure-headless CMS
* How the Jamstack approach drives a culture of shipping for web teams
* How the Netlify extension for Magnolia helps organizations create and deliver great digital experiences

We will also discuss how a large retailer transformed its ecommerce solution into a best-in-class composable platform using these practices.
