# Learning How To Learn
- [Learning How to Learn: Powerful mental tools to help you master tough subjects](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn/home/welcome)
### Course Objectives
-   Explain the difference between focused and diffuse modes of thinking.
-   Explain what a chunk is, and how and why you can and should enhance your chunking skills.
-   Explain how working memory and long term memory differ from one another.
-   Describe key techniques to help students learn most efficiently such as: the Pomodoro, metaphor, story, visualization, deliberate practice, and interleaving.
-   Describe actions that hinder students from learning most effectively, such as procrastination, over-learning, Einstellung, choking, multi-tasking, illusions of learning, and lack of sleep.
-   Describe the most important aspects of proper test preparation.
-   Explain the importance of “mindset” in learning.

## Schedule 
### Week 1
#### Focused vs Diffused
##### [[Focused Mode vs Diffuse Mode]]
- links & resources:
	- [📰: Introduction to the focused and diffuse mode](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TEHdxfl2QYK8l0EcSyYXNhibmmgBtP2v/view?usp=sharing)

##### Using Focused Mode vs Diffuse Mode
- Being able to switch between Diffuse mode and Focused Mode is important
	- Intense focus exhausts 
	- Little work every day
	- '[[build a neural scaffold to hang your thinking on]]'

- **notes**
	- Practice Makes Permanent
		- Practice helps strengthen the neural pathways
		- When first learning, the neural pattern is weak
			- as we Practice, it deepens it
			- at first - study hard, focus
				- but then relax, and defuse mode

- **notes**
	- Types of Memory
		- Long Term Memory
		- Working Memory
			- Working Memory tends to be limited to 4 chunks
			- used to think 7 +/- 2
			- Centered out of the Prefrontal Cortex
			- Closing Eyes - Sensory Input
				- connect to - how does this relate to ADHD?
					- She mentions how sometimes we may close our eyes to prevent things from taking up one of those '4 chunks'
						- often - even when watching TV/movies - I'll tend to watch with my eyes closed
						- During class - I'd get in trouble because teachers thought I was napping because I would close my eyes during class, but this was one of the ways that I was paying attention 
		- Long Term Memory
			- Distributed all over
			- When first putting it into long term memory - we need to try it a few times
				- it can become difficult to find the information we need
		- To help moving things from Working Memory / Short Term memory into Long Term memory -> [[Spaced Repetition ]]

- **notes**
	- Sleep helps flush out metabolic toxins in the brain
	- Need to plant the seed for diffuse mode work from focused mode 
	- "Dreaming about what you are learning can help understanding"
	- > You might be surprised to learn that just plain being awake creates toxic products in your brain. How does the brain get rid of these poisons? Turns out that when you sleep, your brain cells shrink. This causes an increase in the space between your brain cells. It's like unblocking a stream. Fluid can flow past these cells and wash the toxins out. So, sleep which can sometimes seem like such a waste of time is actually your brain's way of keeping itself clean and healthy
