# Ad-Hoc Approach without Structure
However, these approach are often

- ad-hoc
- not always recognized as "promoteable work"
- unclear of how it connects to career growth
- unclear of how it connects to business goals - short term / long term

Also, facilitation of these efforts usually falls onto managers who don't have the capacity, or individual contributors - which can be a good growth opportunity for them, if that's what they would like to do.

But the facilitation around these learning and development efforts takes time:

- coordination
- content management
- follow-ups 
- turning notes from guild meetings / etc into actionable / useful knowledge 
- capturing information and refining it
