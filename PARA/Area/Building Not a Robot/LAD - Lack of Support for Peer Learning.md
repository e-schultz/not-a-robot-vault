I think one of the challenges with scaling a learning culture, is because for smaller teams and early stage start-ups, there is a lot of peer-to-peer and collaborative learning going on naturally.

As the team size grows, and new teams start to form - the flow of information between teams can start to slow down.

- Differences between Rangle / Agency, and Product Company
	- Rangle
		- Different team = totally different team, code base, client, etc
			- tech stack was pretty common, at least for the front end
				- Angular + NgRx 
				- React + Redux 
	- Product Company
		- Could be different teams, but still working on the same repo's 
		- more shared domain knowledge 


Anyways - what used to just happen naturally, isn't enough to keep the learning culture growing as the team grows.
