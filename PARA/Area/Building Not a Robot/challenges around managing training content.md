- training content management can be a pain
	- keeping things up to date
	- in sync with code examples
	- exercises / examples / sample apps 
	- keeping up with framework / library changes and breaking changes
		- the speed of breaking changes seems to have slowed down a bit recently 
	- content authoring tool chain
- environment to follow along
	- issues with peoples environments / etc - e.g) people not able to npm install - and time spent debugging that
	-  things like [[CodeSandbox]], [[StackBlitz]], [[Repl.it]], etc can help with this
