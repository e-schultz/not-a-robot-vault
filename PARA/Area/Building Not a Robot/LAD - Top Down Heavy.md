# Top Down Heavy

But, it seemed like lots of companies end up taking a very top-down approach with learning and development, and an assumption that I have is that many places fall along the lines of

- HR Lead 
- Top Down 
- For Self Directed 
	- Budget 
	- Can use that for courses, conferences, etc
	- "Netflix of Learning"

and that learning/training and development is considered a cost and not an investment.
