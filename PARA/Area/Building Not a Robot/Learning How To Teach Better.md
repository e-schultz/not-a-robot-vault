# Goal: Wanting to Learn How To Teach Better
It hasn't been that often in my career that I've really set a specific goal. I've never been a 5-year career map kind of person, I've never had an intentional career roadmap or plan. [^1nfm]

[^1nfm]: **note** I think this may be why it can feel new to try and do it for others. maybe?

But, in one of the rare few times I've decided on a specific goal - it's that [[I wanted to learn how to teach better]]. and in turn - help others learn how to teach.

## Was more of a realization than a goal

When I was working at Rangle.io, I wore many hats - but some of the things that I enjoyed the most, and found most rewarding was things related to

### The Many Hats
related: [[What I Actually Did At Rangle MOC]]
- teaching
- mentoring
- workshops
- writing - writing for our blog, helping support it,
- helping others write
- public speaking / presenting
- helping with meetups and events 
- helping others with presentations
- facilitating guilds / knowledge sharing 
- also helping with the programs that supported these things
 
I also helped start cross-project code reviews, overseeing the process, providing coaching on how to do code reviews and have them be helpful. 

## Training for Clients

I was also on client projects, had direct reports, and wore various other hats while at [[Rangle.io]].

Rangle also offered training as a service - and I helped create and run a number of training programs for JavaScript. AngularJS, Angular, React, etc. 

We'd have people hire us to teach their teams JavaScript - so we had a number of people create training material, learn how to run through it, etc.

I took a few workshops by [[Greg Wilson]] on "How to run a workshop workshop", and have always found them useful, and the book [Teaching Tech Together](https://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html) [^tt1] is still something I reference often.

## Teaching in General

I really enjoyed helping other people at Rangle work on blog posts, conference talks, CFPs, etc. 

There is a lot of skill that goes into technical writing, and making it approachable and accessible. 

I was supporting them in writing in many ways, but also teaching them how to teach. How to break down ideas, consider the experts blind spot, guide the reader along.
