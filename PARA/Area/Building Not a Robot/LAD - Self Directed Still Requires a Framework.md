here is an abundance of content available online, and content aggregation can help pull sources together - but content curation is a key aspect. 

- the learner persona 
- company context
- what is valuable 

- self-directed is not the same as self-paced learning

	- road-map
	- how does it connect to career growth
	- what are the company needs
	- will they be able to apply this?
