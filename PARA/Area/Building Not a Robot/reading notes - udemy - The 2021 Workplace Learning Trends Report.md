> When asked to rate the maturity of their program, however, a bright spot emerges. A large number of organizations would be considered mature with [Bersin's Learning Organization Maturity Model](https://joshbersin.com/2012/09/the-new-best-practices-of-a-high-impact-learning-organization/). [^blo]
>
> More than half of survey respondents (58%) reported that their organization's learning and development program is at level 3 or 4, the highest levels of maturity. These organizations empower their workforce to drive their own development and have integrated learning into the flow of work.
>
> But close to half of organizations (42%) reportedly have fairly traditional approaches to learning and development. What's keeping them — and even the most mature learning and development programs — from achieving their goals? According to our survey, lack of time was reported to be the biggest obstacle.

##### Impact of COVID 19 on Needs

> “COVID-19 has really accelerated the shift from ‘remote-accessible' to ‘remote-first' thinking in collaboration design,” says [Sprintkick](http://www.sprintkick.com/) founder and [Udemy instructor](https://www.udemy.com/user/evankimbrell/) Evan Kimbrell. “It used to be the case that a large organization was considered ‘progressive' if they could accommodate one remote worker in each functional team. Now, we're seeing a complete inversion of this paradigm.”

The Retail industry made an effort to hone its business etiquette skills by increasing consumption 2,042% compared to the previous year.

##### Promote Learning - some suggestions

> - **Ask leaders to share lessons from their past experiences:** Leadership signals are the most powerful and impactful mechanisms for spreading a culture of learning. Encourage leaders to be vulnerable and admit their mistakes, too. There's a lot of wisdom to be gained from failure.

> - **Include learning in career development and performance conversations: **At least twice a year, share observations of employees' talents, coach them to think through their peak career experiences, and connect them with opportunities to try new things and learn more in areas where they're looking to grow.

> - **Hold postmortems and retrospectives on projects: **Successfully completing a project is a reason to celebrate. It's also an opportunity to reflect and build a culture of healthy feedback. A good postmortem takes an honest look at the completed work and asks, “How can we do better next time?”
