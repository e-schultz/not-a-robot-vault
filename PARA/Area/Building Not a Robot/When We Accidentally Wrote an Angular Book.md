+ [[+ What I Actually Did At Rangle MOC]]


- [Rangle.io - Angular Training Book](https://angular-2-training-book.rangle.io/)
- Angular 2 was coming out - we needed to level up people internally on it, as well as clients
- There was also a demand for Angular 2 training in general
- A lot of the work done on the Angular Training Book was done as a part of Support Squad 
	- note: I think 'peak support squad days' came a bit before the Angular push, tk
- Initially used GitBook - with the intent of it being a slide deck
	- had done some other training slides with GitBook before - especially when it was just markdown
	- The GitBoook was used as training slides a few times
	- Over time - the content grew enough, that it essentially turned into a book 
- Over time - maintaining the book became a big pain in the ass
	- Angular - updated and frequent breaking changes
	- Keeping code examples in sync with the book
	- etc
	- Some of the [[challenges around managing training content]] we had, I experimented with when I had created the [[My JavaScript + React Training Course|javascript + react training course]], and experimented with things like
		- MDX
		- Components in slides
		- Interactive slides
		- code sandbox for examples
