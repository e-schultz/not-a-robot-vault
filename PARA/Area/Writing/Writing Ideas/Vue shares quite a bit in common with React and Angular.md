# Vue shares quite a bit in common with React and Angular

I remember when [[Evan You]] was at the [[Rangle Vue Meetup with Evan You - tk]], and there was the break out session that did a deep dive into how Vue works, and also had the opportunity to go for lunch / dinner with him. 

Evan was inspired by both React and AngularJS, and even though at first glance - the templates make it look closer to AngularJS, but conceptually it's closer to React.
