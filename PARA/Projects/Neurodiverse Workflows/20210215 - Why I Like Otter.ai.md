# Why I Like [[Otter.ai]]

- ðŸ¤” I think I may have found another benefit of auto transcription software.
  - ðŸ§  It captures accidental information-dump in meetings and helps process what was a rather overwhelming output of information.
- Was having a one on one, and something that I'm working on kinda plays into a special interest - that is also connected to a few other things that I'm really excited about.
  - It woulda been impossible to keep up with to write down
- Some of this stuff has also been kinda stuck in my head recently, and I've tried writing it down - but it wouldn't come outright.
  - and this was just like, the right set of prompts clicked in my head, and *information vomit*
- and - I don't think I would have even remembered what I said.
  - At times when I do that, it's like some sort of autopilot kicks in, and words just flop out.
  - and then forget what I said moments later.
- Being able to go back and edit the transcript after - and the editing flow with otter is really nice (for me), helps me remember better.
  - I don't edit every transcript, and how much I do - depends on what I need it for.
- But going through to fix up spelling, add breaks (it doesn't add paragraphs well and it's a lot of wall of text) - but the mix of reading/fixing/listening / re-listening is really useful for me.
- I kind of appreciate that the transcript quality isn't always perfect, as part of my reason for using the tool is to help with sensory issues.
  - Something about the editing and hearing the sound bites replay as I edit and skip around just clicks in my brain.
