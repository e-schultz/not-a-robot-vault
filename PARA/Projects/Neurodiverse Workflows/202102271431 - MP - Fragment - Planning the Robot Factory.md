Was just thinking of what kind of taxonomy/tagging/organization system would make sense in terms of the "not a robot" as a way to group notes.

# Assembling the Robot Parts

## Rough Thoughts on Grouping
- brain -> things that I'm thinking about, processing
- heart -> what makes me human, and not a robot 
- body -
- parts 
	- -> kind of like the inbox, some may be unsorted 
	- -> intent to turn into other parts
- factory
	- -> starting to put things together
	- -> assembling larger notes out of the parts 
	- -> inputs -> assembly line -> outputs 
	- -> the help desk
		- -> guides
		- -> reference materials
		- -> helps navigate through the notes
- recreation
- maintenance 
	- -> self care?
	- -> how-to on maintaining the digital garden?
- campus 

## Why?

Even though these notes are public, and the primary audience is well - me, for those who do stumble across this site, having it make some sense would be useful.

But, even with the audience of me, it can be easy to get lost in the network of thoughts, what is something that is a toss away note, what is something that I want to work on more, what is something that I'm tracking as an active project, etc.

There are inputs -> things that have entered this vault from elsewhere.

Inputs can be articles, my own highlights/notes that have been imported from elsewhere, things that I'm might be wanting to read more, etc.

This can make the inbox a very noisy place, and this isn't limited things filed under the inbox folder here,  but in all sorts of other places I have things tagged as inbox/input, etc. 

At some point, need to decide when to move things from the inbox, into a group, or if I need to eject it from the inbox. 

- Inboxes that never empty become ones that you don't trust
	- You then end up creating yet another new inbox, in a new note, app, tool, and repeat the process

While writing this, reminded me of "Evergreen note titles are like APIs" from [Andy's working notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/) [^matuschakEvergreenNoteTitles]

### When Sorting the Inbox

- Where did it come from?
	- Was it imported from another tool? 
		- Was the import of something that I wrote? 
			- eg) syncing my tweet threads
		- Was the import of something I commented on?
			- eg) Highlights + annotations 
		- Was the import of someone elses tweet thread that I found useful?
	- Was it from a a journal entry -> morning pages or otherwise
	- Was it split off from another note?
- What do I want to do with it?
	- Do I simply want to store it?
		- This could be references/resource materials - and just bookmarks that I want to find later
		- This could be long-form stuff I've written else where, and just want to give a more permanent home within this garden
	- Do I want to research more on it?
		- At times "ideas" can be inputs, and can see that alot when I've imported something with key words like 'expand on', 'I would like to', and at times I may intentionally use certain emoji's to indicate something 
	- Do I want to turn it into
		- a note
		- a an article
		- a ???
