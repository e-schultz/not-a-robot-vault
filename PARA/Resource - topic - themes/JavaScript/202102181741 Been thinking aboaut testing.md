- Thinking about testing
- unit tests, unit vs integration vs e2e tests
	- are tests pass / failing for the expected reasons
		- reminds me of an older blog post I wrote awhile ago - [Are Your Unit Tests Failing for the Expected Reasons](https://dev.to/rangle/are-your-unit-tests-failing-for-the-expected-reasons-4n26)[^es1]
	- testing concepts that apply for front end, back end, regardless of framework, language, etc

![[Scaling End-To-End User Interface Tests - Slack Engineering#^e1d6f9]]

when tests fail for reasons that have nothing to do with the thing you are testing, confidence drops - tests should pass, or fail for expected and related reasons
