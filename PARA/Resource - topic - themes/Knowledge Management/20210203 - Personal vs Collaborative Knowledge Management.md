# Personal vs Collaborative Knowledge Management

This is when I started to use RoamResearch - initially it had started out as me basically using it like an Notes entry on the daily pages, and over time - built up quite a robust [[personal knowledge management]] system.

Since there wasn't mass adoption of Notion at work yet, there was some stuff scattered around confluence, and a bunch of things in Google Drive, shared google docs, and things buried in the history of slack.

So basically, I decided to embrace the chaos - and used Roam to build my own kind of second brain - my notes became my working memory, that contained links to all of the other locations things were shared.

If I had a one on one meeting - and we had a google shared doc for it, I'd copy/paste the meeting notes into my own system, a link to the shared doc.

**Exposing my Brain**

I remember a few times showing a few co-workers my Roam Brain - it was both impressive, and overwhelming - and confusing for anyone else to use. 

But, that was because I had started to realize the value of 'Personal' in Personal Knowledge Management. 

#### Personal Knowledge Management is Personal

This is where I was getting hung up when I was trying to setup my notion workspace awhile ago - I was wanting to use it as a personal system, since there wasn't company adoption yet.

But, I couldn't help but thinking of the collaborative aspect - how can I make it easy to understand for other people, where do other people expect to find things, when is something a 'note', a draft, final form, or is it a living document?

When I started to build my PKM - I made it in a way that made sense to me - making use of back-links, knowledge graphs, block-refs, quoting myself from other documents - and treating almost everything as an ongoing living document. 

#### Source of Truth

Something that was important - was to consider what was the 'source of truth' for something, and I considered my notes to be "My understanding of X".

If I had notes written about a jira ticket - these were /my/ notes, /my/ understanding about the ticket - the ticket in jira was the source of truth.

### Note Taking - Your Doing It Wrong

I don't feel like deep diving into geeking out about notes right now, but another thing that started to resonate with me was the idea of

- notes that are meant for curation
- notes that are meant for creation and idea synthesis

I was always more concerned on the curated aspect - the final note, in it's fully edited form, that was easy for others to follow and understand. 

This certainly has it's role - especially for shared notes and collaborative notes, but it completely undervalues all of the work that goes into making that final version. 

Not everyone needs to see my rough work - but, once you learn how to [[ðŸŒ± - make your notes work for you]], they start to save you time instead of costing you time. 

Concepts like [[ðŸ’¡ - Evergreen Notes]], [[ðŸ’¡ - Smart Notes]], [[ðŸ’¡ - Zettelkasten]], etc all startde to catch my attention - and in 2020, it was the year that "holy shit I'e been taking notes wrong all my life" [^2020notes]

## Collaborative Knowledge Management

Collaborative Knowledge Management has a different set of concerns, while I've been learning to tailor my personal notes for a way that fits my brain, and how I think - when trying to build it for a team, department, or entire organization - it needs to be understandable by more than just myself. 

I really hate confluence, and with some of the other tools I've used before, Notion I think ends up being a really good fit.

## Notion for Teams 

There's been a few tools I've used in the past - but Notion is the one that seems to stick the most. 

- It has a shallow learning curve for getting started
- Does just enough things well enough to be useful 
- Databases, Linked Database, and being able to create views is part of the secrete sauce 

I've wanted to explore alternatives like [Coda.io](https://coda.io) but haven't had a chance to deep dive into it. 

### Good Enough is Close Enough

Being able to view a database as a Board, can let you get most of the value that we typically get out of using Trello.

Is Trello more powerful? yes - and in some causes it's the way to go, but when you want a simple kanban board that is easily linked into your notes about the thing that the board is fore, "close enough is good enough"

Being able to create relationships between tables - allowing you to model parent/child, or related-item relationships between documents is really handy.

When this is combined with being able to create linked views of the master database - being able to have a source of truth, but then customize where and how it's displayed in other places is really damn handy. 

#### Same Data Different Places, Different Faces 

For example, I am setting up a content tracker for lunch and learns, I'm able to have the same table drive a

- I Have an 'Admin' page with a table that has 
	- table view when I want to do quick updates on many items at once
		- I can have multiple views with different columns visible depending on my needs
	- can have a kan-ban board view to easily see whats todo / in progress / done / etc
	- have a calendar view available to show the scheduled / confirmed lunch and learns
- Have the home page of the L&L hub 
	-  with a calendar view of the upcoming scheduled talks
	-  a table below to submit new ideas - that feeds into the same table



### Sometimes Too Close

One of the things that can bug me about Notion, and this may be a power-user software-engineer thing, but there are so many times where I find myself thinking 

- "if I could just do an inner join on these two things", 
- or wishing that the table view was just a little bit closer to google sheets
- or customize how a database gets rendered a little bit more 

It can do some formulas - but it's no google sheets, and now and then I hit these edge cases of wanting just a _little_ bit more power. 

#### Think Notion and ....

But, as you start to hit these limits - you start to see where Notion fits in, in also being able to connect to other data, and act as an information portal to make things easier to find than blindly searching google drive.

Can have databases that link to your google sheets, or docs, or slides - as there are many things that make sense to not live in Notion. 

Especially in the remote world - we have so many collaboration tools, and data lives in so many places. 

The number of applications I use every day can almost seem overwhelming

- Google Docs
- Google Sheets
- Google Drive
- Google Slides
- Namely
- Office Vibe
- Trello
- Slack
- Lever 
- Jira
- [[Otter.ai|Otter]]
- Miro
- Figma
- Loom
- etc

and I'm probably missing a few - and for some people, it's probably more. 

Often in my notes - I'll create attributes for links to jira, [[Otter.ai|otter]], etc - so when I'm going back to that note, I can quickly access links that I need.

There are lots of things that can live in notion - lots of notes, documentation, meeting note type of needs can fit well in notion, and the extra formatting/etc of Google Docs isn't needed. 

But - lots of things do live better outside of Notion - when you build it as a hub that makes those other resources easier to find and navigate, especially for people who are new to the company and team, is when you start to get a lot of value.
