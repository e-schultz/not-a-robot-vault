# Personal vs Collaborative Knowledge Management

This is when I started to use [[Roam Research]] - initially it had started out as me basically using it like an Notes entry on the daily pages, and over time - built up quite a robust [[personal knowledge management]] system.

Since there wasn't mass adoption of Notion at work yet, there was some stuff scattered around confluence, and a bunch of things in Google Drive, shared google docs, and things buried in the history of slack.

So basically, I decided to embrace the chaos - and used Roam to build my own kind of second brain - my notes became my working memory, that contained links to all of the other locations things were shared.

If I had a one on one meeting - and we had a google shared doc for it, I'd copy/paste the meeting notes into my own system, a link to the shared doc.

**Exposing my Brain**

I remember a few times showing a few co-workers my Roam Brain - it was both impressive, and overwhelming - and confusing for anyone else to use. 

But, that was because I had started to realize the value of 'Personal' in [[personal knowledge management]]. 

#### Personal Knowledge Management is Personal

This is where I was getting hung up when I was trying to setup my notion workspace awhile ago - I was wanting to use it as a personal system, since there wasn't company adoption yet.

But, I couldn't help but thinking of the collaborative aspect - how can I make it easy to understand for other people, where do other people expect to find things, when is something a 'note', a draft, final form, or is it a living document?

When I started to build my PKM - I made it in a way that made sense to me - making use of back-links, knowledge graphs, block-refs, quoting myself from other documents - and treating almost everything as an ongoing living document. 

#### Source of Truth

Something that was important - was to consider what was the 'source of truth' for something, and I considered my notes to be "My understanding of X".

If I had notes written about a jira ticket - these were /my/ notes, /my/ understanding about the ticket - the ticket in jira was the source of truth.

### Note Taking - Your Doing It Wrong

I don't feel like deep diving into geeking out about notes right now, but another thing that started to resonate with me was the idea of

- notes that are meant for curation
- notes that are meant for creation and idea synthesis

I was always more concerned on the curated aspect - the final note, in it's fully edited form, that was easy for others to follow and understand. 

This certainly has it's role - especially for shared notes and collaborative notes, but it completely undervalues all of the work that goes into making that final version. 

Not everyone needs to see my rough work - but, once you learn how to [[ðŸŒ± - make your notes work for you]], they start to save you time instead of costing you time. 

Concepts like 
- [[ðŸ’¡ - Evergreen Notes]], 
- [[ðŸ’¡ - Smart Notes]], 
- [[ðŸ’¡ - Zettelkasten]], 
- etc 

all started to catch my attention - and in 2020, it was the year that "holy shit I'e been taking notes wrong all my life" [^2020notes]

## [[Collaborative Knowledge Management]]

Collaborative Knowledge Management has a different set of concerns, while I've been learning to tailor my personal notes for a way that fits my brain, and how I think - when trying to build it for a team, department, or entire organization - it needs to be understandable by more than just myself. 

I really hate confluence, and with some of the other tools I've used before, Notion I think ends up being a really good fit.
