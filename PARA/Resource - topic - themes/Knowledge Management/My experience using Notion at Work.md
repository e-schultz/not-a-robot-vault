# Notion at Work
There's been a few tools I've used in the past - but Notion is the one that seems to stick the most. 

- It has a shallow learning curve for getting started
- Does just enough things well enough to be useful 
- Databases, Linked Database, and being able to create views is part of the secrete sauce 

I've wanted to explore alternatives like [Coda.io](https://coda.io) but haven't had a chance to deep dive into it. 

### Good Enough is Close Enough

Being able to view a database as a Board, can let you get most of the value that we typically get out of using Trello.

Is Trello more powerful? yes - and in some causes it's the way to go, but when you want a simple kanban board that is easily linked into your notes about the thing that the board is fore, "close enough is good enough"

Being able to create relationships between tables - allowing you to model parent/child, or related-item relationships between documents is really handy.

When this is combined with being able to create linked views of the master database - being able to have a source of truth, but then customize where and how it's displayed in other places is really damn handy. 

#### Same Data Different Places, Different Faces 

For example, I am setting up a content tracker for lunch and learns, I'm able to have the same table drive a

- I Have an 'Admin' page with a table that has 
	- table view when I want to do quick updates on many items at once
		- I can have multiple views with different columns visible depending on my needs
	- can have a kan-ban board view to easily see whats todo / in progress / done / etc
	- have a calendar view available to show the scheduled / confirmed lunch and learns
- Have the home page of the L&L hub 
	-  with a calendar view of the upcoming scheduled talks
	-  a table below to submit new ideas - that feeds into the same table



### Sometimes Too Close

One of the things that can bug me about Notion, and this may be a power-user software-engineer thing, but there are so many times where I find myself thinking 

- "if I could just do an inner join on these two things", 
- or wishing that the table view was just a little bit closer to google sheets
- or customize how a database gets rendered a little bit more 

It can do some formulas - but it's no google sheets, and now and then I hit these edge cases of wanting just a _little_ bit more power. 

#### Think Notion and ....

But, as you start to hit these limits - you start to see where Notion fits in, in also being able to connect to other data, and act as an information portal to make things easier to find than blindly searching google drive.

Can have databases that link to your google sheets, or docs, or slides - as there are many things that make sense to not live in Notion. 

Especially in the remote world - we have so many collaboration tools, and data lives in so many places. 

The number of applications I use every day can almost seem overwhelming

- Google Docs
- Google Sheets
- Google Drive
- Google Slides
- Namely
- Office Vibe
- Trello
- [[Slack]]
- Lever 
- Jira
- [[Otter.ai|Otter]]
- Miro
- Figma
- Loom
- etc

and I'm probably missing a few - and for some people, it's probably more. 

Often in my notes - I'll create attributes for links to jira, [[Otter.ai|otter]], etc - so when I'm going back to that note, I can quickly access links that I need.

There are lots of things that can live in notion - lots of notes, documentation, meeting note type of needs can fit well in notion, and the extra formatting/etc of Google Docs isn't needed. 

But - lots of things do live better outside of Notion - when you build it as a hub that makes those other resources easier to find and navigate, especially for people who are new to the company and team, is when you start to get a lot of value.
