### Fleeting vs Permanent 

In the book [[üì∞ - How to Take Smart Notes]] - they talk about fleeting notes, project notes, permanent notes, etc -and there is a difference between these, and the value they can have, and how they can be used. ^32dc4f

If you have piles of journals, or dozens of google docs - that you never go back to, rarely refer to, and has basically been just a 'braindump to offload your memory' and never return to, and find that making your notes valuable is hard - this is the mistake of treating every note as a permanent note, even though those are more of your fleeting notes.

Basically - everything under this daily note / morning pages / evening ramble is a bunch of fleeting notes. 

Eventually I'll start to refine ideas - and maybe make smaller notes, concept anchors, atomic notes that capture key thoughts - and link them to other notes.

It might not be a big essay, or a blog post, or an article yet - but it's lifting things out of this stream of consciousness, and making them a bit more concrete.

Then over time - when I want to write more in-depth on a topic, like maybe one day I want to actually write an article on [[Feedback Advice for Neurodiverse Employees]] (which I do want to do at some point ) #tk 

I can skim these fleeting notes and tag things, start turning them into outlines, look at my smaller atomic notes or seedlings or whatever note taxonomy I decide to go with - and start pulling in information from what i've already written.

A large part of the work is already done.
