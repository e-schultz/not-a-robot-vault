# Notes for [[@chanOurRoadmapBecoming|Our Roadmap for Becoming a Strategic]]

Ok, ended up taking long enough notes on this during the [[2021-02-09 - The Evening Ramble]], that I pulled it out to it's own page for now.

## Highlights

> For too long, Learning and Development teams have been seen as extraneous. Nice to have, but not vital. Many companies view L&D as a service provider for employees instead of a strategic partner for growth. [h.](https://hyp.is/MYQ7gms-EeujW0chktmTpQ/360learning.com/blog/chief-learning-officer/)

> Many companies view L&D as a service provider for employees instead of a strategic partner for growth

I've talked about this before when brain storming on how to teach companies to become teaching organizations, and partnering more closely than one-off training that is very off the shelf. 

> To earn that seat in the C-suite, L&D leaders need to develop a long-term plan to coordinate their department with larger company goals and initiatives. [h.](https://hyp.is/ldX4Hms-Eeua5isGGi1q7Q/360learning.com/blog/chief-learning-officer/)

So, I've been talking about this at work - and how to get learning aligned with company goals, while also being able to learn while working. 


###  The evolving role of Chief Learning Officer

> As the role of L&D becomes more critical to growing businesses, the job description of CLOs evolves from simple training managers to key players in shaping a more effective workforce.

As the role of L&D becomes more critical to growing businesses, the job description of CLOs evolves from simple training managers to key players in shaping a more effective workforce.

### What is a Strategic CLO?

Ah, yes. 

> To transform L&D into a key strategic partner, it’s not enough to simply oversee learning operations; you need to integrate them with the organization’s goals. [h.](https://hyp.is/FQ_89ms_EeuwDscZHdHGxg/360learning.com/blog/chief-learning-officer/)

> Similarly, the Strategic CLO is interested in more than just skill development. They want to ingrain learning and development into every aspect of the company. **The Strategic CLO’s goal is to irrevocably tie L&D functions to a larger company strategy.**

## 3 major challenges L&D departments face right now

#### 1 Misalignment between business and learning strategy

> L&D teams that don’t tie their departmental goals to large company initiatives and strategies will find it almost impossible to obtain the C-suite buy-in they need to grow. [h.](https://hyp.is/imzguGs_EeuZ-m_fEqHcqw/360learning.com/blog/chief-learning-officer/)

#### 2. L&D teams are overwhelmed and underequipped

> [More than 30% of L&D professionals](https://emeraldworks.com/resources/research-and-reports/strategy/back-to-the-future) report being “extremely concerned” about their team’s resources and skills. And a study by LinkedIn Learning found that [almost half of L&D professionals](https://learning.linkedin.com/content/dam/me/learning/resources/pdfs/LinkedIn-Learning-2020-Workplace-Learning-Report.pdf) spend half their week keeping up with training requests.


> The solution is to leverage L&D more effectively by restructuring the way the company as a whole approaches learning. A decentralized, bottom-up approach to learning management transfers more authority for needs assessment and course creation to individual employees and frees up L&D to tackle more significant projects.


#### 3. The reluctance of the business team to invest time in learning activities**

> A lack of buy-in from leadership severely handicaps what L&D can accomplish. [More than 45% of L&Ds](https://emeraldworks.com/resources/research-and-reports/strategy/back-to-the-future) are “extremely concerned” about the business team’s reluctance to invest time in learning.


> This isn’t just about training budgets. Apathy towards corporate learning has a trickle-down effect throughout the company.

People can feel when it's really not supported - especially when it feels like a need to ask for permission all of the time.


## 5 steps to succeed as a Strategic Chief Learning Officer

 - KPIs, Process and Tools

### Step 1: Create a CLO mission statement that aligns with corporate strategy


> you must redefine the department’s goals and mission to reflect larger organizational goals. Lead the way by creating a Chief Learning Officer Mission Statement that incorporates the following three pillars:

![](https://images.prismic.io/360learning/122b1120-19e0-471e-bb74-65fb2fdc4a32_blog_chief-learning-officer-step-1-CLO-mission.png?auto=compress,format)

- **Pillar 1: Develop talents to build and reinforce company culture**

> To achieve this goal, you’ll need to design more effective learning paths and introduce programs that create a broader culture of learning inside the company.

- **Pillar 2: Enable business performance today and tomorrow**

> As CLO, you’ll need to develop a method for rapidly [assessing gaps in employee knowledge](https://360learning.com/blog/skills-gap-analysis/) and a mechanism for quickly providing employees with the content they need to improve their performance and build new skills. [h.](https://hyp.is/imzguGs_EeuZ-m_fEqHcqw/360learning.com/blog/chief-learning-officer/)


- **Pillar 3: Continuously improve L&D productivity**

> To do this, you’ll need to introduce new technology and learning methods that help the L&D department work more efficiently. For example, adopting [Collaborative Learning](https://360learning.com/collaborative-learning) can help you decentralize the learning process by allowing employees to use their unique institutional knowledge to create training courses. [h.](https://hyp.is/iizcImtCEeurMyOL36EjBQ/360learning.com/blog/chief-learning-officer/)


This is kind of what I've meant when I've been saying having a culture of teaching, instead of a culture of learning.

and/or - needing to invest in helping people learn how to teach better.

#### Step 2: Create a strategic framework and roadmap

> -   **Pillar 1:** Encompasses programs that help attract, maximize, and retain the best talent. This includes global [onboarding](https://360learning.com/blog/employee-onboarding-process/), [compliance training](https://360learning.com/blog/compliance-training/), creating a cultural learning framework, and creating self-directed learning mechanisms.
> -   **Pillar 2:** Includes programs that help the employee learn specific skills that improve their performance: retail workforce training, sales enablement, and software adoption.
> -   **Pillar 3:** Includes all initiatives that help L&D work more efficiently: workflow automation, CRM integration, and endeavors to digitize in-person training programs. [h.](https://hyp.is/9bN-iGtCEeufovO_uQRdMg/360learning.com/blog/chief-learning-officer/)

- I've been talking about improved onboarding, and how this can also help with rotation between teams. 

#### Example Three-Year Roadmap

![Example Three-Year Roadmap](https://images.prismic.io/360learning/b9f4e757-4960-464d-aac4-94b4cac9a8fc_Blog_chief-learning-officer-step-2-strategic-roadmap.png?auto=compress,format)

#### Step 3: Define the CLO governance model

> **Your governance model acts as a mechanism to:**
>
> -   keep your roadmap up to date
> -   evaluate and validate budget decisions
> -   ensure that business and learning strategies stay aligned
> -   monitor project completion
> -   create advocates for L&D inside the business team
> [h.](https://hyp.is/aCSMMmtDEeu-D8s6vLuQpg/360learning.com/blog/chief-learning-officer/)
> 


> This model is split into four components:
>
> -   **L&D Governance Board**. Provides strategic oversight and validates the CLO’s roadmap and choices. This board would include senior executives and the CEO.
> -   **Executive L&D Committee**. Monitors the roadmap’s progress, helps remove roadblocks to completion, and suggests adjustments to keep the roadmap aligned with business priorities.
> -   **L&D Steering Committee**. Select members of the L&D team who frequently meet to monitor the roadmap and identify and remove potential blockers.
> -   **Learner Advisory Committee**. A select group of non-L&D employees who provide feedback on current and future learning initiatives and act as ambassadors for their teams.


#### Step 4: Build a CLO organization that is both hybrid and agile

> Creating a useful organization is no easy task. The ideal CLO organization is a paradox. It needs to be [agile enough to pivot to meet challenges and new training needs](https://360learning.com/blog/agile-learning-culture-l-and-d/) that arise but also specialized enough to stay on track for meeting corporate objectives.


 #### Step 5: Implement the right tools and processes
 
 ## Strategic CLOs can transform more than just L&D
