# Learning Culture vs Teaching Culture

This is something that has been on my mind for awhile, and keep circling back around to it in various ways.

I've seen lots of companies claim to have a learning culture, and maybe they once did - when they were smaller, people worked closer more often, more organic [[peer to peer teaching|peer-to-peer teaching]] happened - and it happened organically. 

Then, as teams grow and scale - there is this desire to cross your fingers, and hope what started organically - keeps growing organically.

It rarely does. 

Some of the challenges I think, and found that some of these were mirrored in [[@chanOurRoadmapBecoming|Our Roadmap for Becoming a Strategic Chief Learning Officer]]

### Questions

- Why teaching culture instead of learning?
	- Learning can become passive
		- Tends to focus more on 'content consumption' - tutorials, workshops, webinars, "[[Netflix of learning]]"
	- self-directed learning can also be mistaken for "hands off learning"
		- self directed still needs guidance
	- at a smaller scale, [[peer to peer teaching]] can happen organically, this can start to break down as teams scale.
	- Teaching is more active
		- Teaching done well, 
			- helps ensure that the student understands and is able to apply
			- helps people 'learn how to learn' as well and how to approach similar problems
			- Takes the student into consideration 
			- Takes the context of the company / team / etc into consideration
			- Teaching is more than conveying information - it's not a one-way info-dump
		- "You can someone a fish before you teach them to fish, it's easier to learn when you're not hungry"
		- Teaching something, tends to require people to learn it better in the process of teaching
			- concept maps
			- unpacking the "just" when explaining things 
			- uncovering the experts blind-spot

- What do I think the benefits are?
	- More scaleable 
	- Offers more growth opportunities for all levels
	- Avoids bottlenecks from leadership / L&D team
	- Becomes the way that a company works
	- connects soft-skills / core / communication skills to peoples career growth
	- closer aligned to business needs / goals - as teaching in the context of solving problems on the current project
- How does this differ from a learning culture?
