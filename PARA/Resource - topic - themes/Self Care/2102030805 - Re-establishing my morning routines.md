# Re-establishing my morning routines

One of the things that I've noticed in the path that really helps me have a smooth morning - is simply well, having things on hand to have a smooth morning.

- Something simple for breakfast
- Coffee
- Milk 

Getting up and having a bit of the routine to get moving right away to put on the pot of coffee, put down some toast and then feed the cats - gets me moving, and usually a bit of tidying up along the way.

I've found that if I don't have simple breakfast things handy - the prompt to get out of bed, and stay out of bed isn't nearly as strong. 

When it comes to [[+ Self Care MoC]], I've been learning to check in with certain markers, red flags, patterns as potential signs to see if something is going on that I might not be consciously aware of at that time.

It's looking at what some of my anchors are, and then evaluating them - are they drifting, and also - why? not everything is necessarily a problem.
