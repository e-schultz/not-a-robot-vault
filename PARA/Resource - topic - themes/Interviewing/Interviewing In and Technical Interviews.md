# Interviewing In and Technical Interviews

It also reminded me of a good article by [[@laurieontech]] - [Senior Interviews != Three Junior Interviews In a Trench Coat](https://laurieontech.com/posts/senior-interviews/) - and identifies some of the pitfalls that we can fall into when interviewing for senior roles.  ^b58c6d

I've made this mistake in the past myself - applying the same approach as a junior interview to a senior interview, and it just doesn't work. There are very different skill sets that I'm looking for.  

So, now when thinking about Interviewing In, Inclusive Interviewing, and the differences between interviewing for junior and senior.

- What considerations do we need for Interviewing In for junior?
- What considerations do we need for Interviewing In for senior?
- What supports do we need to provide for them to be successful once joining?
- What does this look like in a remote-first world?

I don't know the answers to these - but it's something that's on my mind, and I'll probably continue to expand on in this journal.
