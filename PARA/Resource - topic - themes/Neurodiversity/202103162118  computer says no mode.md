This is a weird feeling, and one of those "was it anxiety, was it burnout / shutdown mode". 

It feels like all of my inputs are saturated, and my brain just doesn't want to accept any more sensory input. 

When this gets bad - my stutter can get worse, I can start to feel foggy / brain fog. 

I've also called these bad brain days
