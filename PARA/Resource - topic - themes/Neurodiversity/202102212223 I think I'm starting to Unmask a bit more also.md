I think this also has something to do with it in general - there is something about going remote that sort had put me into 'masking all the time' mode, and at times forcing too much structure onto myself, and there were days/[[202102212226 weeks where it'd feel like I'm breaking my brain|weeks where it'd feel like I'm breaking my brain]]. 


- Sometimes the unmasking has been intentional, and measured
- Sometimes it's been accidental
- Sometimes it's because I'm just so fried, and it's unintentional - but I don't really have an option

This does seem to have an interesting side effect though of at times

- Feeling really at ease, comfortable, confident 
	- then shortly after wondering if I shared too much, was too much, or was over whelming
- Feeling like if I've enjoyed myself
	- That there must be something that I'm missing

When you have decades of when 'you just being you', got comments like you are too intense, too much, etc - when you have those moments where you do feel really at ease, and like you are being yourself, it can have a follow-up feeling of insecurity.

Being vulnerable can be scary at times.
