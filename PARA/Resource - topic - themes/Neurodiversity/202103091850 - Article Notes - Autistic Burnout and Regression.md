## Reading Notes

Reading [Autistic Burnout & Regression](https://iammyownexperience.com/2017/08/01/autistic-burnout-regression/) [^rossAutisticBurnoutRegression2017], and one of the quotes that really jumped out at me.

> Another area of regression is going shopping at the grocery store or being out in town. It’s not like I particularly enjoy either of these things, but I could certainly just about cope for enough time to get done what I need to and then leave without incident. Now, I will actively wait to go grocery shopping until a guaranteed quiet time (usually around 7pm Friday or Saturday and either 10am or 2pm on a Sunday) and sometimes have had to resort to putting in my earplugs or headphones in order to minimise sensory overload (noisy kids or the rickety stock trolleys staff drag along with squeaking wheels and rattling metal!). The only time we go into town now is when we get haircuts. Whereas before we would wander amongst the shops and look around for a while, our routine now is to go for an early lunch at Jane’s Pantry, maybe nip into Boots first to pick up a few items, then go home.

Groceries have been really, really hard for me recently - I'll put off going, the thought of going makes me anxious. Once inside - it's too bright, I'll use my headphones and go through as fast as possible.

This is also resulting in my diet right now largely consiting of

- Coffee
- Clif Bars
- Kombucha 
- Maybe some meat / cheese / bread 

and even then - I can go in, and miss half of what I've been meaning to get. If it wasn't for my cats - I could put off going even longer.

At the start of lockdown - I had actually gotten into enjoying making more food at home - I wasn't like super-cook by any means, but I'd stock up on things in bulk (minimize the number of trips I needed to make), 

Now - it just feels so.fucking.exhausting

and even if I do have food, I remember when I was getting the GoodFood boxes - by the end of the day I'd feel so shot, that trying to follow the instructions of like pre-packaged, pre-measured food was too difficult. I've thrown out so many of them, just to have Toast instead.
