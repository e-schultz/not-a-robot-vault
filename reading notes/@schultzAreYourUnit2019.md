## Abstract
Unit tests can be an invaluable tool in the developers toolbox. You don&#x27;t need to be a strict TDD purist to make unit testing worthwhile. Once you get into the flow of writing tests, it can be rather satisfying to watch the Nyan Cat Reporter go across your screen as the number of tests passing increase.

However - if your tests are failing / passing for unexpected reasons, it can undermine the confidence in your unit tests.
