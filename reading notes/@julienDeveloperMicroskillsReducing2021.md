## Abstract
I had a topic in mind for this week, but a friend of mine mentioned that context-switching is a big hang-up for him lately. This is a subject near and dear to me and I realized I hadnâ€™t written about it yet.

Context-switching is a huge pain as both a developer and developer advocate. You open up a codebase you havenâ€™t looked at in a few months and it takes you a long time to get your head back into the game. Thereâ€™s also the daily context-switching that comes from bouncing between meetings or switching from creating content to coding. The biggest problem with context-switching is the drag it introduces in the time between idea and execution. Itâ€™s hard to be creative when youâ€™re doing a bunch of prep work to get your mind right.
