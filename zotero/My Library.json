Attendees included managers in various human resource positions as well as vice presidents and top decision-makers from many of the top banking, industry, government, and tourist organizations. After presenting this group with the findings from our research on workers with neurodiversity, the researchers asked those attending to respond to the same questions from the original research, including the same demographic descriptors. The research utilizes Boyer’s Model of scholarship’s third element, application of research findings, shared directly with those in a professional association. Thus, we had academic research presented to those in industry, who then added to existing research from their given perspectives. The qualitative inquiry, a collaborative social research, generated responses that were coded and analyzed in this paper. This research furthers the knowledge of addressing workers in the workplace that possess learning disabilities and HR’s responsibility and knowledge to train, educate, and be able to make reasonable accommodation in accordance with HR diversity requirements.\n\nKeywords: HRM practices, neurodiversity in the workplace, Bahamas human research\nmanagement, qualitative research.","author":[{"family":"Styles","given":"Jason"},{"family":"Knowles","given":"Lisa"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,3]]},"source":"ResearchGate","title":"From Academia to Industry: C-Suite Contributors to Perspectives on Neurodiversity in the Workplace","title-short":"From Academia to Industry","type":"article-journal"},
