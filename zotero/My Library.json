This study adopted a quasi-experimental research design. Two classes of eighth grade students (N = 64) from one middle school participated in weekly 45-minute online question-generation learning sessions for 6 consecutive weeks.

  {"id":"johnj.h.linReadingSubtitlesTaking2016","abstract":"[ABSTRACT The present study investigated the effects of providing subtitles and taking enotes on cognitive load and performance. A total of 73 English-as-a-Foreign-Language (EFL) undergraduates learned brain anatomy and cognitive functions through multimedia programs. We used a 2 (subtitle/no) x 2 (taking enotes/no) factorial design to test the following: (1) if cognitive demand would vary among different groups, and (2) if providing subtitles or taking enotes would facilitate learning. Four versions of multimedia materials had exactly the same content and differed only in the availability of subtitles or enote functions. The enote tool was designed for effective note-taking with regard to video/animation, making it possible to directly link notes to a specific scene. The results indicated that animation with subtitles groups help reduce cognitive load and increase performance. No significant differences were found in either cognitive load or post-performance for those who learned with or without taking enotes. Although previous studies suggest subtitles may lead to a split-attention effect for native learners, we found a dual-coding effect (or reverse split-attention effect) for EFL learners.]","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,25]]},"archive":"JSTOR","author":[{"literal":"John J.

  {"id":"kramarSynapticEvidenceEfficacy2012","abstract":"The superiority of spaced vs. massed training is a fundamental feature of learning. Here, we describe unanticipated timing rules for the production of long-term potentiation (LTP) in adult rat hippocampal slices that can account for one temporal segment of the spaced trials phenomenon. Successive bouts of naturalistic theta burst stimulation of field CA1 afferents markedly enhanced previously saturated LTP if spaced apart by 1 h or longer, but were without effect when shorter intervals were used. Analyses of Factin-enriched spines to identify potentiated synapses indicated that the added LTP obtained with delayed theta trains involved recruitment of synapses that were \"missed\" by the first stimulation bout. Single spine glutamate-uncaging experiments confirmed that less than half of the spines in adult hippocampus are primed to undergo plasticity under baseline conditions, suggesting that intrinsic variability among individual synapses imposes a repetitive presentation requirement for maximizing the percentage of potentiated connections. We propose that a combination of local diffusion from initially modified spines coupled with much later membrane insertion events dictate that the repetitions be widely spaced. Thus, the synaptic mechanisms described here provide a neurobiological explanation for one component of a poorly understood, ubiquitous aspect of learning.","archive":"JSTOR","author":[{"family":"Kramár","given":"Enikö A."},{"family":"Babayan","given":"Alex H."},{"family":"Gavin","given":"Cristin F."},{"family":"Cox","given":"Conor D."},{"family":"Jafari","given":"Matiar"},{"family":"Gall","given":"Christine M."},{"family":"Rumbaugh","given":"Gavin"},{"family":"Lynch","given":"Gary"}],"container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","ISSN":"00278424","issue":"13","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012]]},"page":"5121-5126","publisher":"National Academy of Sciences","title":"Synaptic evidence for the efficacy of spaced learning","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/41588431","volume":"109"},

We contend that note taking might best involve a three-stage process where the missing stage is revision. This study investigated the benefits of revising lecture notes and addressed two questions: First, is revision more effective than non-revision? Second, what revision method is best? Experiment 1 addressed the first question by comparing the performance of participants who revise or recopy lecture notes. Experiment 2 addressed the second question by investigating whether revision was best done (a) during pauses throughout the lecture or one equally-timed pause after the lecture, and (b) with a partner or alone. Dependent measures were original and additional notes and fact and relationship test scores. Results upheld three effects: (a) a modest revision effect—revisers recorded more additional notes and achieved somewhat higher scores on relationship items than re-copiers, (b) a pause effect—those revising during pauses outperformed those revising after the lecture on the notes and achievement measures, and (c) a modest partner effect—those revising with partners recorded more original notes than those revising alone. Furthermore, the combination of pauses and partners has merit and holds promise as a means for revision. Overall, findings suggested that revision is a new student-centered means to boost lecture note taking and achievement.]","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,25]]},"archive":"JSTOR","author":[{"family":"Luo","given":"Linlin"},{"family":"Kiewra","given":"Kenneth A."},{"family":"Samuelson","given":"Lydia"}],"container-title":"Instructional Science","ISSN":"00204277, 15731952","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016]]},"page":"45-67","publisher":"Springer","title":"Revising lecture notes: how revision, pauses, and partners affect note taking and achievement","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/26302984","volume":"44"},

We wrote the first version of the Scrum Guide in 2010 to help people worldwide understand Scrum. \n\nWe have evolved the Guide since then through small, functional updates. Together, we stand behind it.\n\nThe Scrum Guide contains the definition of Scrum.\n\nEach element of the framework serves a specific purpose that is essential to the overall value and results realized with Scrum. Changing the core design or ideas of Scrum, leaving out elements, or not following the rules of Scrum, covers up problems and limits the benefits of Scrum, potentially even rendering it useless.\n\nWe follow the growing use of Scrum within an ever-growing complex world. We are humbled to see Scrum being adopted in many domains holding essentially complex work, beyond software product development where Scrum has its roots. As Scrum’s use spreads, developers, researchers, analysts, scientists, and other specialists do the work. We use the word “developers” in Scrum not to exclude, but to simplify. If you get value from Scrum, consider yourself included.\n\nAs Scrum is being used, patterns, processes, and insights that fit the Scrum framework as described in this document, may be found, applied and devised. Their description is beyond the purpose of the Scrum Guide because they are context sensitive and differ widely between Scrum uses.

Attendees included managers in various human resource positions as well as vice presidents and top decision-makers from many of the top banking, industry, government, and tourist organizations. After presenting this group with the findings from our research on workers with neurodiversity, the researchers asked those attending to respond to the same questions from the original research, including the same demographic descriptors. The research utilizes Boyer’s Model of scholarship’s third element, application of research findings, shared directly with those in a professional association. Thus, we had academic research presented to those in industry, who then added to existing research from their given perspectives. The qualitative inquiry, a collaborative social research, generated responses that were coded and analyzed in this paper. This research furthers the knowledge of addressing workers in the workplace that possess learning disabilities and HR’s responsibility and knowledge to train, educate, and be able to make reasonable accommodation in accordance with HR diversity requirements.\n\nKeywords: HRM practices, neurodiversity in the workplace, Bahamas human research\nmanagement, qualitative research.","author":[{"family":"Styles","given":"Jason"},{"family":"Knowles","given":"Lisa"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,3]]},"source":"ResearchGate","title":"From Academia to Industry: C-Suite Contributors to Perspectives on Neurodiversity in the Workplace","title-short":"From Academia to Industry","type":"article-journal"},

After you pop the champagne, accept the shiny new title, and step into this thrilling next chapter of your career, the truth descends like a fog: you don't really know what you're doing.\n\nThat's exactly how Julie Zhuo felt when she became a rookie manager at the age of 25. She stared at a long list of logistics--from hiring to firing, from meeting to messaging, from planning to pitching--and faced a thousand questions and uncertainties. How was she supposed to spin teamwork into value? How could she be a good steward of her reports' careers? What was the secret to leading with confidence in new and unexpected situations?\n\nNow, having managed dozens of teams spanning tens to hundreds of people, Julie knows the most important lesson of all: great managers are made, not born. If you care enough to be reading this, then you care enough to be a great manager.\n\nThe Making of a Manager is a modern field guide packed everyday examples and transformative insights, including:\n\n  *  How to tell a great manager from an average manager (illustrations included)\n  *  When you should look past an awkward interview and hire someone anyway\n  *  How to build trust with your reports through not being a boss\n  *  Where to look when you lose faith and lack the answers\n\nWhether you're new to the job, a veteran leader, or looking to be promoted, this is the handbook you need to be the kind of manager you wish you had.","author":[{"family":"Zhuo","given":"Julie"}],"ISBN":"0-7352-1956-7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,3,19]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"288","publisher":"Portfolio","title":"The Making of a Manager: What to Do When Everyone Looks to You","title-short":"The Making of a Manager","type":"book"},
