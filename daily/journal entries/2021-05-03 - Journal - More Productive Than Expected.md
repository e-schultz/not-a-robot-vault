# [[2021-05-03 - Journal|ðŸ“…]] - More Productive than Expected

So it's 16:30 - and it feels like I've gotten more done today, than I have all of last week.

- was up early
- spent some time on social media, but not much - didn't fall into the 'endless scroll until mid-afternoon'
- Switched into 'digital garden maintenance mode' - and did a bunch of clean-up / organizing of notes
	- some twitter discussion inspired some writing ideas and organization which was nice
		- [[tweet-thread with @rothecoder about vue]]
- Did a bunch of cleaning
- Did a shoppers run
- Got laundry done 
- Setting myself up for hopefully an ok week
