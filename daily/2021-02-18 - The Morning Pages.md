# The Engineer Manager Pendulum

Got reading [The Engineer Manager Pendulum](https://charity.wtf/2017/05/11/the-engineer-manager-pendulum/) by [[Charity Majors|@mipsytipsy]] 

Took some notes while reading it[^engp],  a few points that stood out to me

[^1engp]:[[The EngineerManager Pendulum]]

## Management is not a promotion

although lots of companies seem to think it is.

## Management isn't the only career progression 


> ![[The EngineerManager Pendulum#^97c45f]]

When management is treated as a promotion - people can feel trapped there. Moving back to IC from management shouldn't be seen as a demotion - these are career shifts. [^justevan1]

# Onto the work Daily Bootup 

Anyways, need to start doing my daily bootup at work - having a bit of time to collect my work thoughts before jumping right into stand-up helps.

Last few days been a little bit 'checking slack 5 mins before the first meeting of the day' -> not a good habit to start
