# Was More of a Readwise Review

Was more of a readwise review than my morning pages - but was nice to start having some useful notes / highlights pop back up.

Reviewing what I've read, and written about before helps deepen that understanding, and connect it with newer things I've learned.

Helps avoid the constant content consumption but not retention flow that is easy to fall into.

Need to think about how/when to import those notes and highlights over into here.

Another thing I need to consider is - when do I start discarding items from my Readwise? #question 

I tend to always hit keep - even if I've written a lot in it before, or if I see it surface but don't add anything.

Although, it was interesting to see some highlights/notes pop up from stuff that I was reading last night.

**Anyways** ....

Got my reading / writing itch scratched for the morning and need to get some food into me - still lacking in groceries, so probably Timmies again.
