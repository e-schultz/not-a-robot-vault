# 2021-02-27 - [[The Morning Pages]]

# [[Good Morning Evan, how are you doing this morning]]?

Not so bad, started off in a bit of a twitter hole, then doing some read-wise review of my daily inbox, and starting to figure out a better flow for using obsidian, templates and how to organize things a little bit better.

## Tweaking Readwise -> Obsidian Workflow

Been playing around with how I handle readwise, taking notes there - and how I get things into Obsidian.

## Energy Levels

My energy levels have been a bit all over the place the past week, and have seen some self-care warning signs pop up, another one that tends to happen, [[202102271340 - MP - self care warning signs|no mess, but the garbage bins are full]]

# Evergreen Note Titles are like API's

> When [Evergreen notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4SDCZQeRo4xFEQ8H4qrSqd68ucpgE6LU155C) are factored and titled well, those titles become an abstraction for the note itself. The entire note’s ideas can then be referenced using that handle [^matuschakEvergreenNoteTitles]
