# [[Good Morning Evan, how are you doing this morning]]?

Doing all right - had a pretty good sleep last night, woke up a little early - almost 5:00am or so, took a long lasting dex and went back to bed, and finally got stirred out of bed by like 7:00am or so.

Instead of falling into doom-scroll or youtube-hole, got out of bed, put on some coffee and have some chili cooking for breakfast.

Puttering around while my brain get's moving. ^384c72

# [[The Playlist]] Alpenglühen 56 w/ Adhémar & F-on

![[Alpenglühen 56 with Adhémar & F-on#^665468]]

There are a few sets by F-ON that I've listened to before, especially his sets from Alpenglühen that I've really enjoyed.

They usually start off with a pretty slow build, but then create a nice dubby headspace for my brain to rest on.

This set is like, 5 hours long - haven't listented to this one yet before, but did a quick skim and being my morning soundtrack feels appropriate.

# [[Readwise Review]]

Going through readwise today, and popped up an old tweet thread by [[@e_p82]] from a few months ago when I was having really bad issues with my eye sight and light sensitivity

##  Six Reasons Why Diversity of Thought Is Not Enough

re: [[@inklusiivSixReasonsWhy20a19|Six Reasons Why Diversity Of Thought Is Not Enough]] [^6why]

I had heard [[diversity of thought]] pop up a few times recently, which kind of makes my ears go up and a few red flags - as often aiming for diversity of thought, is something that can undermine a companies DEI efforts.

While the article as a whole is pretty interesting, one of the key takeaways for me that can sum it up in about a sentence, at least as a starting point

> Diversity of thought should be the outcome of diverse representation, never the target itself.

The article then continues to point out that when referring to Diversity of Thought, we are generally referring to four groups - that we all have access to.

- analytical, 
-  organized, 
-  interpersonal
-  strategic

When we are talking about Diversity at work, it's about diverse representation - not a cognitive diversity of preferences.

## From Thinking, Fast and Slow

> Intelligence is not only the ability to reason; it is also the ability to find relevant material in memory and to deploy attention when needed. - [[Daniel Kahneman]]

A trap that I used to find myself in, and one that I still do - is equating 'being smart' to 'being able to remember well'.

Especially when I was undiagnosed with ADHD - I would put effort into thinking "I need to remember better", and not as much in "I need to be able to build systems to support better recall"

and this kind of goes inline with some of the common [[neurodiverse microaggressions]] that I hear people say, things like
