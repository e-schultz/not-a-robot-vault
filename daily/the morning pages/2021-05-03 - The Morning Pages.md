### Good Morning ....

- [[Good Morning Evan, how are you doing this morning]]?
	- Doing all right 
		- woke up at around 6:00am before my alarm 
		- trying to avoid the 'wakeup and social media right away', but did end up killing some time on twitter - but got a few writing ideas for it.
			- got some possible writing ideas 
				- [[Vue for X Developers]]
					- [[Vue for React Developers]]
					- [[Vue for Angular Developers]]
				- [[React for Angular Developers]]
					- ![[React for Angular Developers#^856d2b]]
		- and played around with the Obsidian Mobile App on my iPhone
			- Seeing how it can fit into my workflow, I also have the Drafts App - which I haven't used that often, and then the iOS Notes app which is still the default brain-dump ground when I'm walking. 
			- Setting up some sort of short-cut to move things from that over into Obsidian with the correct inbox / moc tag could be kind of useful 
	- Thinking about [[how can I make better use of Obsidian]]
		- The DataView plugin seems pretty powerful 
			- although I do wish it was able to see things while in 'edit' mode somehow - but oh well. 
			- I do think that this Vault is starting to reach the 'Information Tipping Point'  of which I'm having enough notes, that it's getting hard to find things at times.
				- DataView queries can help with this
					- can query on any attribute in the front-matter YAML
					- can I setup some sort of SRS style system to surface certain notes
				- Maps of Content
				- Stuff under PARA 
					- In my mobile vault, changed [[PARA to PATA -> T for Topics]] / Themes --- which is what "Resources" is, but something about the word resources just didn't stick in my head well, might make that change here
				- better use of tags / ways to indicate status
					- reading / proof / processing / etc
				- Spend more time editing / cleaning up notes - not just adding 
					- spent some time last night moving things around, sorting the inbox, etc - and some things are starting to surface a bit better where I'd expect them to.
