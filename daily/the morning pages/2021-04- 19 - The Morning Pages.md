# [[2021-04-19|ðŸ“…]] The Morning Pages

##### Another Week Begins 

Last week felt like a pretty good week, although the incompetency of the Ford government in handling COVID-19, the vaccination roll-out, the threat of over-policing, only to then roll it back has been a little bit exhausting, even if I did manage to make time to go for a few nice long walks over the weekend.

### Morning Rituals

As I was having my coffee in the park across the street, it did get me thinking about [[202104142215 Rituals over Routine|Ritual vs Routine]], and how to adapt this thinking more into my daily rituals. 

It is easier during nicer weather to fit the 'morning walk around the park/block' before starting my day, trying to motivate myself for a walk when it's cold, snowing and I need to layer up is a pain.

It was a bit chilly when I first started, but when I sat down and started to catch up on some emails/etc on my phone - sun started to warm up a bit more and got quite nice outside. 

One of the important things that I'm noticing for me, is to simply start moving and doing _something_

#### Small Steps

This is something I've written about before, but just getting moving can be enough to start the day rolling in the right direction - getting caught up in doom-scrolling and social media tends to not go that well. 

The occasional day - it's fine, but it's very easy to slip into the habbit of getting sucked into Twitter / TikTok / whatever, and next thing I know it's almost lunch.

Getting back into working with [[The Happy Book]] and setting up a bit of a light weight schedule.

Simply having a few chores on there like

- feed cats
- sweep
- go for walk
- wipe down counter
- etc

Helps get me up and moving and not needing to think too much, while I'm waiting for my brain to get rolling. 

#### Little Rituals 

##### Feeding of The Cats

Well, this is more of a requirement - I don't want my cats to die :) but recently, especially during the week - been noticing that I wake up pretty early.

Usually use this time to feed the cats, put on a put of coffee, have some water - take my ADHD meds, and then crash for a bit more depending on how early I woke up.

For example, this morning - woke up at like 4:30am, but - I had a pretty solid sleep.

##### Rising of the Desk

One of the ways that I've been trying to mark the start/end of my days - is simply rising or lowering my standing desk.

First, it's been moved back out to my Living Room, the [[202120216 - Bedroom Office|bedroom office]] is no more, and also moving my laptop out from my bedroom onto the desk.

##### Few Quick Chores

A few small simple chores that require low-thought/effort, but get me moving also help - and if they are written down in my book, even if I have a morning where I'm spacing - can take a quick look 'oh yeah, been meaning to sweep today' - these are just little things that help get me moving, brain thinking, without suddenly filling my head up with cognitive sludge before I even get my day started.
