# 2021-02-23 - [[The Morning Pages]]

Got caught up doing a bunch of Readwise review in yet-another-vault, going to use that as a bit of a rough inbox while going over my readwise notes before importing things over here for now.

Although, did start to generate a zet ID using the same format I use here for each thing I review, so should be easy to move things over and not have any conflicts. *fingers crossed*
