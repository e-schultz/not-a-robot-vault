# 2021-02-19 - [[The Morning Pages]]

# [[Good Morning Evan, how are you doing this morning]]?

Not too bad, woke up pretty early - at like 5:30, before my alarm - been having a bit of a smoother start to my mornings.

## Improving The Morning Routine 

Lacking of breakfast food, and oddly Uber Eats has no delivery people near by, but - maybe do a quick timmies run soon and then deal with getting breakfast food on the weekend. 

Fast food for breakfast every day doesn't serve me well in the long wrong.

### Music Helps - [[The Playlist]] On the 5th Day Podcast #126 - Claudio PRC

Been making a point to put on some music at the start of the day more often, and --- I like it.

When I used to walk to work all the time - the walking, and ~40+ minutes of being able to listen to music really did help clear the head for the day. 

### Reading and Review

But, got reading a few articles, taking notes - getting the head moving, looking forward to the day ahead.

Also set an alarm for 8:45am for 'shift into work mode'.

### Smooth the Transition into Work Mode 

Even though I have been getting up earlier recently - has been a few times I've got caught up doing other things that bleed into the start of working, and then jump into my first meeting at short notice.

So - set an alarm for 8:45am to hopefully nudge me out of 'overly focused on other stuff', and encourage me to start shifting gears into getting ready for work.

Let's keep an eye on how this goes.

## Impact = Environment x Skills 

Got reading  [Impact = Environment x Skills: How to make career decisions](https://www.reforge.com/blog/how-to-make-career-decisions) [^bk] by Bangaly Kabla  ^b831ee

[^bk]: [[@kabaImpactEnvironmentSkills2021]]

In the article, he goes over some of the common traps of career decisions such as:

> 1. Choosing To Work On The Shiny Object
> 2. "I Just Need To Work On Myself More"
> 3. Short-Term Thinking
> 4. Solving for Brand
> 5. The Seductive Cesspool of Mediocrity 
> 6. Mixing Perception and Truth

And then going into detail on the Impact Framework Equation
