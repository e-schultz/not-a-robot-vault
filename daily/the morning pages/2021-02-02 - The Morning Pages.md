# [[2021-02-02]] - [[The Morning Pages]]

Woke up fairly early today, well before my alarm - at around 5:50 or so - fed the cats, made some coffee, watched a bit of YouTube before starting to scroll through my tweeter feed.

It's interesting how I use different forms of social media, and the value I get out of them - and how I engage with them. 

## When I was Banned from Twitter

Over the Holidays this year - I got banned from twitter for awhile, the tl;dr was - I couldn't verify my phone number because SMS texts would not arrive, and all of my accounts got locked out. 

[[2020 Was the year I finally got twitter]], and had found a nice pocket of the - queer tech neurodiverse doesn't worship Elon Musk side of twitter, and started to build online friendships there and people that I would interact with daily, and having that cut off over the holidays kind of sucked.


## Returning to TikTok

With that online-social outlet cut off, I got back into using TikTok daily. 

There are aspects of TikTok that I really do enjoy, but I also find it can be a bit exhausting at times 

- the rapid fire swiping from informative videos
-  to viral dances
-  to hot-take reactionary videos to bigots, racists, homophobes and transphobes.
-  and everything else in between

The comment section on TikTok is clunky - with tweet-like limits on how much you can say, responses that appear out of order - I don't think I've actually had a conversation in a comment section on TikTok, the closest you can really get to is making video replies to comments on your own. 

But - there are sides of TikTok that are fun - I've done a mix of my own 'attempt at informative videos', shared weird art, done duets, jumped on trends, or done back and forth duets with friends as a way to spend time - but it can also feel like a constant stream of sensory overload. 

## Getting Twitter Back

My main account for twitter has been [@e_p82](https://twitter.com/e_p82)  [^1] - and that had stayed locked out for awhile, but I managed to get an alt account back  [@evan_just_evan](https://twitter.com/evan_just_evan) [^2] shortly after the new year, and then like magic - a few days later the ban got lifted from [[@e_p82]]. 

[^1]: [[@e_p82]]
[^2]: [[@evan_just_evan]]

Even though I have access to both accounts now - I've been spending a bit more time on [[@evan_just_evan]] 

While I have been on twitter since around 2014,-I never really "got" twitter for a long time.  

### Controlling the Wall of Noise 

Over the years - had followed over 1,200 people - numerous lists, and got about 1,000 followers myself (most in 2020)  - but my feed was becoming a wall of noise, where it felt like if I didn't refresh once every few minutes I'd be missing something.

While I've tried to make use of apps like [Tokimeki Unfollow](https://tokimeki-unfollow.glitch.me/) to cut back on how many people I was following, or adding them to lists - I could never seem to cut things down enough. 

So - figured now is a good opportunity to build up a new account, with a bit more strategy and intent in who I follow, who I put onto lists - and keeping my feed in a more orderly fashion - however, it does mean that for now - I have far less reach, as [[@evan_just_evan]] only has about 100 followers right now, but I'm pretty ok with that. 

Something I do like about Twitter though, is how it helps me organize my thoughts.

### Organizing my Thoughts

Once I started to get how to use twitter, and really had the ah-hah moment of threads = micro-blogging is when I started to become much more active on twitter. 

I find it interesting that even when I am near my laptop - and a full sized keyboard, I still tend to do most of my tweets from my phone.

the 150-character limit, and the slower means of input - tends to help guide me to breaking down my thoughts into smaller chunks that are easier for me to express, and at times - easier for others to follow. 

It helps convert my information-dump, into bite sized bits of information that are easier to digest, and a few of my tweet threads feel like they are a bit of a first-draft of a longer form of writing.

It also gets my thinking out of passive consumption vs active thinking 

#### Active vs Passive Social Media Use

When I'm on TikTok in the morning - especially on weekdays, it becomes more of a passive consumption of content - scrolling from one thing to the next. On weekends I may make more videos - and making videos takes ore time.

But twitter can quickly turn into more active thought - either a tweet that has resonated with me and gotten a train of thought going. 

Then the times when I'm just in a reflective mood - and end up being more honest with myself than I had expected to be, like when tweeting about how [[1354415951693938694 - I Miss In Person Meetings| I miss in person meetings]], and quickly turned into being more honest about just how exhausted I am. [^3]

One of the things I missed most about twitter, was the [[Neurodiverse Twitter]] community.

[[@dreamsofskies]] had an excellent thread on [processing my thoughts in front of strangers](https://twitter.com/dreamsofskies/status/1356487360045715456),  and it really got me thinking about my own experiences of being in school and [[1356571318020431872 - Getting in trouble and not knowing why|getting in trouble and not knowing why]], and how a good day at school for me was:

![[1356571318020431872 - Getting in trouble and not knowing why#^022fa2]]

#### [[Threading Your Thoughts]]

Another thing I find useful on twitter, is [I really appreciate people that make good use of tweet threads.](https://twitter.com/evan_just_evan/status/1356414008346238978) - being able to quote-tweet yourself to expand on a thought, pulling other tweet threads into your own threads - and creating a bit of a network of information. 

One of the challenges with twitter, and I think note-taking in general - is how easily your thoughts can get lost in the wall of noise, but if you make it a habit to link your thinking over time - you can start to resurface old notes, expand on them, connect them - and start building up a network of resources that can be more useful than simply bookmarking things.

I have my [[threads of threads]] on both my [@e_p82 account](https://twitter.com/e_p82/status/1282543949975035905) and [@evan_just_evan account](https://twitter.com/evan_just_evan/status/1355281395292270600) 

These include threads of my own, threads of others - and also including other threads of threads. Trying to filter through my likes, or my bookmarked threads - hah! that is a fools errand at times. 

Some of these are short, some are long - but, can also be useful to resurface old ideas - give them new context, expand on them. 

## Wrapping Up ....

Well, I think it's been about an hour - and over 1,000 words written + the things I've spewed onto twitter this morning, but it was nice to return to the morning pages brain dump instead of the mindless scroll on social media until it was time to jump-start my day.
