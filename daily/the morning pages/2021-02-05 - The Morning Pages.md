# [[Good Morning Evan, how are you doing this morning]]?

Not bad, bit groggy - got into a tweet-hole this morning, but helping to organize my thoughts. 

So far - this week has been pretty good, been feeling a bit better both personally, and at work - but, also been a little high energy and feeling it starting to catch up with me a bit.

# Something that I just realized I miss

Listening to music in the mornings, when I used to have to walk to the office - that hour of walking to work and listening to music did me so much good. 

In the summer - I'd try and get out for a short walk each morning before work, but it wasn't quite the same - and usually not as long.

During the winter, the before work walks well - rarely happen, unless you count walking to TIm Hortons across the street.

## Morning Music

Been putting on music in the mornings a bit more the last few days as I start my day, and the current [[The Playlist|playlist]] includes - [MNMT Recordings : Hydrangea - Anecumene@9128.live](https://soundcloud.com/monument-podcast/mnmt-recordings-hydrangea-anecumene9128live)

So good, very much putting my brain into a happy place - and helping me focus, and get into working a bit easier. 

# Kim Craytons Discord

[[Kim Crayton]] has been such a source of good information as I've started to better understand racism, and learning about [[anti-racism]] - and she's starting a discord community.

Going to quickly link a few random tweets/etc that I'll pull in later - gotta get started on work soon.

> "never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity" this is how white supremacy maintains its grip...whiteness being "stupid/ignorant" is not a flaw but a feature of the design. If you knew, as early as Black folx do, about life's reality and how you benefit, there would be some that would be ok with it, but most wouldn't. By the time y'all do see it, it is who you are and requires "efforting" to shift -- [[Kim Crayton]] [discord](https://discord.com/channels/799679615219400806/799679616235077652/807276904792588379)

Today, we are revising the [[Seeing White]] podcast series - I've listened to these before, and found them really powerful and informative. 

Revisiting these and taking some notes might do me some good.
