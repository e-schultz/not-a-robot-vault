## [[Good Morning Evan, how are you doing this morning]]? [^1]

Feeling pretty good this morning - slowly building up my morning routine again, and getting myself setup for a smoother morning.

- Was up well before my alarm - took a long lasting one of my ADHD meds, and then napped for a bit longer
- Woke up just before my alarm - made coffee, fed the cats, puttered around a bit, had coffee
- Killed a bit of time on twitter as my brain got booting up
- and now, done the shift from tweeting in bed to standing at my desk 

### Re-establishing my morning routines

One of the things that I've noticed in the path that really helps me have a smooth morning - is simply well, having things on hand to have a smooth morning.

- Something simple for breakfast
- Coffee
- Milk 

Getting up and having a bit of the routine to get moving right away to put on the pot of coffee, put down some toast and then feed the cats - gets me moving, and usually a bit of tidying up along the way.

I've found that if I don't have simple breakfast things handy - the prompt to get out of bed, and stay out of bed isn't nearly as strong. 

When it comes to [[self care]], I've been learning to check in with certain markers, red flags, patterns as potential signs to see if something is going on that I might not be consciously aware of at that time.

It's looking at what some of my anchors are, and then evaluating them - are they drifting, and also - why? not everything is necessarily a problem.

### Self Care Anchors 

For example, I might look at patterns like

- How often am I ordering in?
- How messy are certain rooms in my house?
- Am I having a hard time, or easy time getting out of bed
- Am I avoiding friends?
- Am I avoiding family?
- Am I avoiding work?
- What does my relationship with my body feel like?
- What has my mood been like recently?
- What does my relationship with my mood feel like?
- What does my relationship with my health feel like?
- What does my relationship with my mental health feel like?
- Am I becoming addicted to busy?

This isn't an exhaustive list, 

If my place is a mess, and I'm ordering in a lot - maybe it is just a case of it's been a busy week, and getting back on top of things isn't a problem - and there isn't anything to worry about.

But, if it's been going on for a few weeks, my Uber Eats Bills is turning into receipts of shame, my body is feeling gross - and finding myself starting to retreat from my social circles - maybe it's time to check in and figure out what is going on.

It's a mix of being aware of what's going on - but also how I feel about that relationship with it. 

Sometimes, feeling good isn't always what it seems.

### Sometimes a good mood can be a warning sign

For example - I may be feeling in a "good mood" in many measures at times, but 

- is there a bit of a manic energy 
- triggered energy going along with it? 
- am I feeling at ease with it?  
- Is the good mood coming at the cost of ignoring other things? 

Something I've noticed in the past - especially if I am starting to enter a bit of a triggered state - is I can start to get kind of excessively positive energy, become hyper social, network and reach out to people more often than I usually do.

This can be a bit of a trauma response for me - warning signs are going off that something isn't "quite right" - and I'm trying to gather as much information, connect the dots between things and figure out what's going on.

The good mood is being propelled by this very intense energy, and being in that state - often other aspects of my self-care routine might start falling apart. 

The good mood, is also part me trying to convince myself that everything is fine - but also trying to project to others that everything is fine.

And, there was a long time in my life when I didn't trust being happy, and it's been a process [[learning to trust happy]] again.
