# 2021-02-11 - [[The Morning Pages]]

- 08:30 - 09:00

## [[Good Morning Evan, how are you doing this morning]]?

Not too bad actually - was a bit tired from yesterday, went to bed pretty early - woke up initially at around 4, wasn't quite awake awake, but not sleepy either.

Took one of my long lasting ADHD meds that takes awhile to kick in, and got cozy in bed until it got me moving.

Spent some time doing my [[Readwise Review]], and also catching up on some things that I've saved to [[Instapaper]] and trying to empty that inbox.

### Bit off a [[Self Care MoC]] - [[morning routine]] reflection 

- The last week or two, had tried to make it a point to at least have enough food in the house for breakfast, so I could:
	- wake up 
	- make my coffee
	-  feed the cats
	-  do a bit of misc tidying
	-  make breakfast - even if it was simply toast 

While this may seem like a small thing, I found that it helps with having a smooth morning and getting me moving a bit sooner. Otherwise, I tend to wake up, feed the cats, and then flop back into bed until I decide to order food - either delivery, or order something ahead from Timmies and run across the street to get it.

But when I know I have no breakfast food/etc, it's so much easier to just stay in bed until the last minute. 

Although, one of the other bits of value I get out of the morning routine, is it helps get my mind moving a bit better - and that is where there is also value in writing things like the morning pages, doing readwise review, or actually engaging and talking on twitter and not just scrolling. 

While some other mornings, I've been up and moving, cleaning, writing, getting ready to work from like 6 or 7am, which helps transition into work mode, today - I finally didn't get out of bed until like 8:30 or so.

# HIV Representation

I've had a few people recommend to me that I should watch the new show It's A Sin - from the creators of Queer As Folk, which I must say - QAF did play a big role in me coming to terms with being gay, appreciating diverse representation of queer people, etc - I'm curious to see what this show is like.

[[@bamullinspeaks]] [tweeted](https://twitter.com/bamullinspeaks/status/1359767814249320450) a bit about the show, and I'm going to need to add his article [How'd You Get It? / Such a Shame](https://brianmullin.substack.com/p/howd-you-get-it-such-a-shame) at some point, #inbox/reading 

But reading his thread, one of the tweets that stood out said:

> Then as now, people with HIV/AIDS deserve agency, dignity and the right to full, satisfying emotional & sexual lives (cf. Denver Principles). Too often RTD’s [#ItsASin](https://twitter.com/hashtag/ItsASin?src=hashtag_click) script presented them as silent or self-hating victims, perpetuating homophobic ideas with its narrative choices. - [@bamullinspeaks](https://twitter.com/bamullinspeaks/status/1359767814249320450)

That line, the presentation of HIV+ people as  _as silent or self-hating victims_ stood out to me, and got me thinking about my own history with HIV, how I've come to terms with it - and better understanding what it means to be HIV+ and proud. 

Link to the my tweet thread - [@evan_just_evan on HIV+ and proud](https://twitter.com/evan_just_evan/status/1359826540981350401) - and added it to my tweet-thread inbox to expand on more later.

### It's kind of funny

Working to music helps me focus alot, but often I forget to put it on in the background - I think the jumping from meetings at times, that when I do have a bit of break between them, the "oh yeah, music" doesn't pop into my head has often.

I should try changing that a bit maybe.

Anyways, 9:00am or so now, should probably start focusing on work stuffs.
