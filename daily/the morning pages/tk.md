# Whats up with tk?

Basically, it means "to come" [^1]
Awhile ago I was reading an article on writing tips, and one of the suggestions that an author had - is when you are in the flow of writing, and can't quite connect two ideas right at this time, or know that you want to expand on something - but not right now, is to simply put #tk - and move on to the next thing while keeping in the flow.

It sort of stands for "to come" - but using tk instead, as very few words in the English language actually have the letters tk side by side in them.

So searching through something you have been writing and looking for 'tk' is an easy way to find spots that you wanted to get back to.

If you are having someone edit/proofread something and something stops abruptly, tk can indicate 'yeah I know - I'll get back to this.

So, if you see #tk, tk. [[tk]] scattered about some of my notes - they are things I hope to get back to at some point.
