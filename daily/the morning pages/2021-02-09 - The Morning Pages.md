# 2021-02-09 - [[The Morning Pages]]

# [[Good Morning Evan, how are you doing this morning]]?

Feeling not that bad, woke up pretty early - like, 4am or something - took one of my long lasting dex pills and went back to bed until it started to wake me up.

Yesterday was a bit of a write-off after I hit that brick wall - ended up ordering delivery again, and then just kind of waited for the day to end.

But, up and moving around none - and started to do something that I haven't done in awhile - start going through my Instapaper inbox, and my Readwise - and starting to review my highlights again.

# [[Readwise Review]]

Before the holidays, I was in a pretty regular cycle of using readwise to resurface old ideas, highlights from books, tweet threads I found interesting - and then expand with my notes and own ideas on them if appropriate. 

One of the challenges I can have with my 'read all the things' - is that my brain becomes a sieve, and the information flowing in - flows right back out.

Getting into a habit of highlighting while I read, adding a few words for extra context - and then reviewing these later on and expanding more, has helped give certain things a sticky factor in my brain.

And - as the notes make it over into my note taking system, and connecting to other ideas - has proven to be pretty useful.

Not sure how I want to work this flow into this vault - do I export from readwise, and mass import everything into here?

Only do new things that I add?

*shrug*

But, one tweet that surfaced that caught my attention was about [[Systems Thinking]] by [[@operaqueenie]]

## [[RW - Lets Talk About Systems...]]

When she was writing about

![[RW - Lets Talk About Systems...#^eb5ea9]] [^op1]

[^op1]: [[@operaqueenie]] - [[RW - Lets Talk About Systems...]]

It got me thinking about the rule from [[José Mourinho]] about [[The Playbook - EP3 - Watching Notes#6 Don't Coach the Player coach the Team|Don't Coach The Player - Coach The Team]], and this also relates a bit to [[The Playbook - EP3 - Watching Notes#1 Understand your audience|Understand Your Audiance]]

We need to consider all levels, and how they interact and integrate with each other. If we focus on the individual person, and not how they operate within the team - we may optimize for them, but not for them working within the team.

Likewise, if we are coaching the team - but not considering the larger organization that it's working within, what are the impacts of that?

And the organization/company doesn't live in isolation - it interacts with the community, has it's own brand, talent brand, etc.

When considering the audience - it's not just about the fans in the stands if we were to take Jose very literally, but how the team is seen within the company, and how the company and organization is viewed by others in the industry.

- Personal Brand
- Team Brand & Culture
- Company Brand & Culture
- Talent Brand 
- How do we view this internally
- How is this viewed externally 

I haven't actually done much of a deep dive into reading about  [[Systems Thinking]] yet, but keep coming across resources mentioning it and it keeps resonating with me, and something I want to read into more, and expand on more.


## [[RW- Developer Experience at Netlify]]

Was reading this article by [[Sarah Drasner]] a few days ago, and forwarded it along to my manager as well. 

It's gotten me thinking about how I'm approaching the Learning Hub, ideas around knowledge sharing and management, education, etc. 

Their team takes documentation, developer experience, etc very seriously - and for a platform that relies a lot on adoption by developers at other companies, this makes sense - but I think some of the same principles can be applied even for internal stakeholders.

As we are considering building out programs like this, and this goes back to the systems thinking, but - how can we create a reinforcing loop? 

![[RW - Lets Talk About Systems...#^76f3cf]]

- **Note:** I like the idea of "one reinforcing loop driving the growth"
      as we are trying to scale our engineering teams - if we are always looking outwards for teaching and training, where is that reinforcing loop? [^evnote1]

# My Own Growth Goals

## [[Learning How To Teach Better]]

The other day, was talking with my manager - as the topic of teaching, education, and how to support employee growth better, and something that clicked a bit in my head was

> I've been here before

Helping setup lunch and learns, workshops, wanting to support people through the process to make it more approachable, how we handle guild meetings, etc. 

And it reminded me of when I was having a chat with Michael Bennett when I was still working at Rangle, and had an ah-hah moment

### At it's core - I was teaching people how to teach

From how to structure blog content to make it easy to follow, consider the audience, introducing the right concepts at the right time, stating any kind of pre-prerequisite, setup, etc.

For workshops, conference talks, etc - many of the same ideas.

I think it was in an interview with [[Jane Elliott]] talking about the origin of the word to educate, comes from the Latin educare, which means to lead out, or to lead out of ignorance. 

Teaching is more than just conveying information - sure, the students heard it - but did they learn it? did they understand it? have they been lead out of ignorance?

### [[end-user teachers]]

This is a concept I've learned from [[Greg Willson]], and his book [[Teaching Tech Together]]

>  teaching isn’t their primary occupation, they have little or no background in pedagogy, and they may work outside institutional classrooms. [^ttendt]

[^ttendt]: [Teaching Tech Together - Who You Are](https://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#s:intro-audience)

### [[Mental Model]] and [[Formative Assessment]]

> The first task in teaching is to figure out who your learners are. Our approach is based on the work of researchers like Patricia Benner, who studied how nurses progress from novice to expert \[[Benn2000](https://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#ref-Benn2000)\]. Benner identified five stages of cognitive development that most people go through in a fairly consistent way. For our purposes, we will simplify this progression to three stages:

> -  [**Novices**](https://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#g:novice) don’t know what they don’t know, i.e. they don’t yet have a usable mental model of the problem domain.
> - [**Competent practitioners**](https://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#g:competent-practitioner) have a mental model that’s adequate for everyday purposes. They can do normal tasks with normal effort under normal circumstances, and have some understanding of the limits to their knowledge (i.e. they know what they don’t know).
> - [**Experts**](https://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#g:expert) - have mental models that include exceptions and special cases, which allows them to handle situations that are out of the ordinary. We will discuss expertise in more detail in Chapter [3](https://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#s:memory)

Understanding the distinction between [[Novices]], [[Competent Practitioners]] and [[Experts]] is important, as your role as a teacher for each group is different.

A flood of information to a Novice can be overwhelming, and if they don't have the correct mental model - might start fitting this new information into the wrong places.

> The cognitive differences between novices and competent practitioners underpin the differences between two kinds of teaching materials. 
> A [**tutorial**](https://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#g:tutorial) helps newcomers to a field build a mental model; a [**manual**](https://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#g:manual), on the other hand, helps competent practitioners fill in the gaps in their knowledge. 
> Tutorials frustrate competent practitioners because they move too slowly and say things that are obvious (though they are anything _but_ obvious to novices). Equally, manuals frustrate novices because they use jargon and _don’t_ explain things. 
> This phenomenon is called the [**expertise reversal effect**](https://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#g:expertise-reversal) \[[Kaly2003](https://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#ref-Kaly2003)\], and is one of the reasons you have to decide early on who your lessons are for. [^ttetmodel]

[^ttetmodel]: [Teaching Tech Together - Mental Models and Formative Assessment](https://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#s:models)

While a novice may benefit most from a tutorial, as the tutorials help build the correct mental model, for [[Competent Practitioners]] - that same tutorial may be boring, gets in the way of what they want to learn  - and a manual might suite them better, or other types of exercises.


# Wrapping up

Feels good to start getting some of this stuff written down again, and/or bought up to the surface of my memory - I know I have lots of notes on this living across scattered systems, but 8:30am - and should probably do a few things before getting ready for work.

But, it does feel nice to have my brain feel booted before entering work-mode, instead of trying to jump onto slack and zoom calls from a cold boot. 

I'm not a robot, I promise.
