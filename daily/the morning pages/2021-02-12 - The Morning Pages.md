[[Good Morning Evan, how are you doing this morning]]?

Pretty good - got out for a quick grocery run last night, and was able to make coffee and have breakfast at home today and not order in, or go grab Timmies. 

# Kim Crayton Discord

[[Kim Crayton]] has started a discord server that's currently running on Fridays for Water Cooler and Happy Hour.

![[Kim Crayton Community Cafe#Community Cafe]]

I've volunteered to be a moderator there, and making time to join in the mornings and afternoons when possible with work, and the moderator training was so useful. 

I'll see if I can share it later, it's a great introduction to building safe spaces, the concepts of anti-racism, prioritizing the most vulnerable. 

It pulls in parts of some of my favorite talks by her, and puts them together in powerful way.

# Transcription Tools

I've been using [[Otter.ai|Otter.ai]] for transcribing meetings at work, which has been a real life saver, and really useful work work settings as I can record meetings as they go.

Kim Crayton just tweeted about looking for Voulnteers to transcribe podcasts, and mentioned [[oTranscribe]] [otranscribe.com](https://otranscribe.com/), 

and also a call to action for volunteers to help transcribing podcasts.

I wonder if I can use Otter.ai to automate it, copy/paste into oTranscribe - and do final cleanup / editing / formatting in there?
