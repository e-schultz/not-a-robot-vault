# Note-taking vs Note-making 

Was trying to empty out my Instapaper Inbox, and reading some old things I had saved to read later, and came across this great article by [[Anne-Laure Le Cunff]] - [From note-taking to note-making](https://nesslabs.com/from-note-taking-to-note-making)  ^f657e8

I have a bunch of notes that I'll need to import later that I took while reading it.

A key point she mentions though when talking about the differences between note-taking and note-making.

> In his 1962 [book](https://amzn.to/2JphCT1) about study methods, Edgar Wright makes the distinction between “note-taking” from “note-making.” Note-taking often happens while listening; the goal is to quickly capture content so we can refer back to it later. Note-making is more common while reading; it consists in deliberately crafting our own version so we can learn and create better. [^ntnm]

Also added a new thread of threads, to my thread of threads.
