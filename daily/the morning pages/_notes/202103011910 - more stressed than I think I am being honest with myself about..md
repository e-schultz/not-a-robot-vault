##### journal entry 

At least I'm doing laundry right now, and made time to meditate a bit in the afternoon.

Not sure if stressed is the right word, or what else is going on.

There is the whole 'It's the one-year anniversary of the Pandemic, that is still going, and anniversaries of hard times can impact people. 

So, there's that.

Wasn't shortly after that, that I got laid off by Rangle, and some aspects of that experience I think I'm a bit sour about, and/or - trying to think of lessons learned, and how to apply those going forward

It just feels like I'm running on empty, and my weekends are not very restful, I get hyper-fixated on some things to the point of exhaustion, and then trying to keep ontop of self-care stuff gets hard.

I need to do groceries, like I have some stuff here - but not much, but the idea of going to the grocery store right now and my brain is just like hard-no, pass.

Even with some projects I'd like to do, or other hobbies I'd like to get back to - finding it hard to get into those, or have those hold my attention. 

Sensory burnout kicking in? --- been a few times I've come close to yelling at the cats when they meow during a meeting, and I know that is usually a sign that I'm starting to circle around burnout.

- am I working towards my goals?
	- what are my goals?
- am I spending energy in the right places?
- am I working with my brain, or against my brain?
- am I actually ok, or trying to convince myself that I'm ok?

Before the unfuck dei seed got planted, felt like I was starting to do pretty good, but I know at times the "energetic" version of myself, can be a bit of a warning flag, but not sure if it was in this case. 

But, maybe.

Was the crash inevitable? or was it just accelerated?
