# [[2021-02-01]] - [[The Evening Ramble]]

## What direction to go?

I keep finding myself flip-flopping between how I want to use this, how to structure it - what type of content I want to put here.

I do want to experiment with making these public, but then at the same time - knowing it's public puts a certain filter onto my thoughts at times.

I was getting into a nice flow using Roam, and also using some of their more advanced features - and I think one of the main differences, while it may seem small at first - is the difference between an outliner, and an editor. 

How quickly I can nest things, create references to other blocks - in Roam that flow comes rather naturally, but something about Obsidian has me thinking more in chunks than blocks - which can have it's own pro's and cons. 

Although one thing I did enjoy about The Evening Ramble when I was doing it before - helped add a bit of structure to my day, wrapping up my end of day thoughts - and also became a bit of a contextual bookmark of things that I was reading online - instead of just being in constant consumption mode. 

I may start doing [[The Morning Pages]] as well - as having that early morning brain-dump was rather useful as well, and helped get things rolling in my head before starting my workday. 

I really should finish reading Smart Notes - and find a nice system in-between. 

I keep meaning to re-start working in my [[The Happy Book]] as well - as I do miss some of the physical nature of writing, and have been finding the last while that some of my day-to-day 'base self care routines' are slipping - something about putting stuff like that into digital form doesn't click as well in my head. 

## The Happy Book

The bright yellow, dot-grid note-book that really did kick off alot of my approaches to self-care, building habits, checking in, reflection -  and two of my older journals are now acting as a wrist-wrest for my keyboard, so having them around as that reminder is still useful in it's own way.

So much of my life has become digital-centric since COVID19 - work, social life, family communication - that once the workday is done, that spending more time at the 
- same desk 
- same laptop 
- same screen 

Quickly looses it's appeal - at times I'll switch laptops, maybe surf Twitter on my phone instead of my laptop, or poke a bit at my what seems to be neglected iPad - despite really enjoying drawing with Procreate. 

I want/need to bring some physical back into my life - motion is important to me, either it be walking, dancing, yoga, stretching - but also writing, drawing, making music - things that engage physical touch and motion. 

## First Therapy at Shift 

I remember the first time going to therapy at Shift - and it felt like I went on a nearly two-hour info dump talking a mile a minute, everything came out all at once - and I was impressed by their ability to both keep up with me, but pick out some important patterns - and offered some actionable advice. 

He noticed how much things relating to movement/motion were for me for self care

- Walking to/from work
- Walking breaks
- Dancing
- Exercise
- Writing in my journal 
- etc 

Being ADHD - it's no surprise that movement is important to me, and find that I often need to be moving to work through my thoughts, or I'll end up trapped in my head. 

A bit of how I've been feeling recently - is giving me some vibes back to my burnout at Rangle, and trying to hit the breaks a bit sooner - and start focusing with a bit more intent on things.

###  Signs of being neurodivergent that you wish you knew about earlier

A few days ago [[@radiantbutch]] tweeted 

> quote this tweet with a sign of being [[neurodivergent]] that you wish you knew about earlier. let’s spread some knowledge and make people feel less alone [^1rb] - [[@radiantbutch]]

The first thing that came to mind for me was Hyperfocus, and then a better understanding of Executive Function 

> I wish I knew about Hyperfocus. For so long I had thought ADHD was only not being able to focus. I think this is a misunderstanding that probably causes alot of people to go undiagnosed for a long time - "but they can focus on X" [^2eje] - [[@evan_just_evan]]

---

> Then executive dysfunction in general. Even after getting a Dx - ended up learning about executive function later on in my own. So many things that I thought I needed to "just try harder at", and get frustrated with - made alot more sense. [^3eje]

## Work Stuffs

For work, we are watching [[The Playbook - A Coaches Rules for Life]] and then discussing it as a group with other managers. So far, the episodes have been fairly interesting - and the next episode, of which I'm helping facilitate the discussion for is on
[[José Mourinho]].

[Blume.cv has a good summary of the episodes](https://blume.vc/the-playbook-episode-3-jose-mourinho-a-coachs-rules-for-life/) - although still worth a watch on their own. 

But, the Rules that Jose has:

1. Understand your audience
2. If you are prepared for the worst, you are prepared
3. The underdog Attack
4. Some rules are meant to be broken
5. The train doesn't stop twice
6. Don't Coach the Player, coach the Team 

Started to watch this a few days ago, but fell alseep part-way through, guess I'll start watching again, and maybe take some notes as I go.
