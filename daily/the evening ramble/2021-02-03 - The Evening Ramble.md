# 2021-02-03 - [[The Evening Ramble]]

Today was a pretty good day actually - it feels like I'm starting to get out of a bit of the funk that I had hit after the holidays, but - there will be up's and downs, so enjoy that I enjoyed today - but don't get all grumpy if I'm grumpy tomorrow. 

# First day in awhile that I've enjoyed going for a walk

Getting outside and going for walks is one of the most important things for self-care that I can do for myself, and when weather + pandemic really starts to limit how viable, and/or enjoyable that is - does not make me a very happy person.

Eaarlier in the week I went for a longish walk because I had to go see my doctor for a [[study visit for the medical trial]]  that I am on, but I was groggy in the morning - the weather wasn't nice, and it felt like a slog - not something that I enjoyed

I've almost stopped paying attention to the weather forecasts - but today during standup at work, someone had mentioned that today was going to be above 0 and sunny in the afternoon - and we encouraged everyone to get outside and go for a walk later in the day if possible.[^1t]

At around lunch, bundled up - but not too warm, and went for a bit of a graffiti walk around where I live, and it was nice to actually feel the sun for the first time in awhile.

# Photos for Video Art Fodder

Had a nice vibe to kick off the walk with. Made a quick [TikTok video with some of the art along the way](https://www.tiktok.com/@evan.just.ev4n/video/6925161132181196038?is_copy_url=0&is_from_webapp=v1&sender_device=pc&sender_web_id=6832640840113718790) once I got back home.

I took one of the photos that was saved as a live photo, converted it to a video - did some edits with Hyperspektive - and now building up bits of my video loop library.

# [[Work Reflections]]

## Building Learning Hubs

At work, I'm building up a learning hub and resource library - and during a 1:1 got talking about [[my first real program]], and how collecting, curating, and building systems / processes to gather and share information is something that I've always enjoyed doing.

Note taking, knowledge management - both personal, and collaborative/team, etc are all kind of special interests of mine.

## Knowledge Management 

When I worked at Rangle, I had helped with the initial adoption of Notion - starting out more as a tech knowledge base, and then got adopted company wide. 

We used it for tracking blog content, guild meetings, some internal projects, I had also used it quite a bit for managing my 1:1 meetings. 

When I started at PartnerStack - I think only the design team was using Notion, I had setup my own personal account to try and manage my work notes in - but at the time, I was wanting something quick and fast - and was finding that Notion was causing me friction. 

## Personal vs Collaborative Knowledge Management 

This is when I started to use RoamResearch - initially it had started out as me basically using it like an Notes entry on the daily pages, and over time - built up quite a robust [[personal knowledge management]] system.

Since there wasn't mass adoption of Notion at work yet, there was some stuff scattered around confluence, and a bunch of things in Google Drive, shared google docs, and things buried in the history of slack.

So basically, I decided to embrace the chaos - and used Roam to build my own kind of second brain - my notes became my working memory, that contained links to all of the other locations things were shared.

If I had a one on one meeting - and we had a google shared doc for it, I'd copy/paste the meeting notes into my own system, a link to the shared doc.

 **Exposing my Brain**

I remember a few times showing a few co-workers my Roam Brain - it was both impressive, and overwhelming - and confusing for anyone else to use. 

But, that was because I had started to realize the value of 'Personal' in Personal Knowledge Management. 

#### Personal Knowledge Management is Personal

This is where I was getting hung up when I was trying to setup my notion workspace awhile ago - I was wanting to use it as a personal system, since there wasn't company adoption yet.

But, I couldn't help but thinking of the collaborative aspect - how can I make it easy to understand for other people, where do other people expect to find things, when is something a 'note', a draft, final form, or is it a living document?

When I started to build my PKM - I made it in a way that made sense to me - making use of back-links, knowledge graphs, block-refs, quoting myself from other documents - and treating almost everything as an ongoing living document. 

#### Source of Truth

Something that was important - was to consider what was the 'source of truth' for something, and I considered my notes to be "My understanding of X".

If I had notes written about a jira ticket - these were /my/ notes, /my/ understanding about the ticket - the ticket in jira was the source of truth.

### Note Taking - Your Doing It Wrong

I don't feel like deep diving into geeking out about notes right now, but another thing that started to resonate with me was the idea of

- notes that are meant for curation
- notes that are meant for creation and idea synthesis

I was always more concerned on the curated aspect - the final note, in it's fully edited form, that was easy for others to follow and understand. 

This certainly has it's role - especially for shared notes and collaborative notes, but it completely undervalues all of the work that goes into making that final version. 

Not everyone needs to see my rough work - but, once you learn how to [[make your notes work for you]], they start to save you time instead of costing you time. 

Concepts like [[Evergreen Notes]], [[Smart Notes]], [[Zettlekasten]], etc all startde to catch my attention - and in 2020, it was the year that "holy shit I'e been taking notes wrong all my life" [^2020notes]

[^2020notes]: [[2020 - The Year I realized I've been taking notes wrong]]


## Collaborative Knowledge Management

Collaborative Knowledge Management has a different set of concerns, while I've been learning to tailor my personal notes for a way that fits my brain, and how I think - when trying to build it for a team, department, or entire organization - it needs to be understandable by more than just myself. 

I really hate confluence, and with some of the other tools I've used before, Notion I think ends up being a really good fit.

## Notion for Teams 

There's been a few tools I've used in the past - but Notion is the one that seems to stick the most. 

- It has a shallow learning curve for getting started
- Does just enough things well enough to be useful 
- Databases, Linked Database, and being able to create views is part of the secrete sauce 

I've wanted to explore alternatives like [Coda.io](https://coda.io) but haven't had a chance to deep dive into it. 

### Good Enough is Close Enough

Being able to view a database as a Board, can let you get most of the value that we typically get out of using Trello.

Is Trello more powerful? yes - and in some causes it's the way to go, but when you want a simple kanban board that is easily linked into your notes about the thing that the board is fore, "close enough is good enough"

Being able to create relationships between tables - allowing you to model parent/child, or related-item relationships between documents is really handy.

When this is combined with being able to create linked views of the master database - being able to have a source of truth, but then customize where and how it's displayed in other places is really damn handy. 

#### Same Data Different Places, Different Faces 

For example, I am setting up a content tracker for lunch and learns, I'm able to have the same table drive a

- I Have an 'Admin' page with a table that has 
	- table view when I want to do quick updates on many items at once
		- I can have multiple views with different columns visible depending on my needs
	- can have a kan-ban board view to easily see whats todo / in progress / done / etc
	- have a calendar view available to show the scheduled / confirmed lunch and learns
- Have the home page of the L&L hub 
	-  with a calendar view of the upcoming scheduled talks
	-  a table below to submit new ideas - that feeds into the same table



### Sometimes Too Close

One of the things that can bug me about Notion, and this may be a power-user software-engineer thing, but there are so many times where I find myself thinking 

- "if I could just do an inner join on these two things", 
- or wishing that the table view was just a little bit closer to google sheets
- or customize how a database gets rendered a little bit more 

It can do some formulas - but it's no google sheets, and now and then I hit these edge cases of wanting just a _little_ bit more power. 

#### Think Notion and ....

But, as you start to hit these limits - you start to see where Notion fits in, in also being able to connect to other data, and act as an information portal to make things easier to find than blindly searching google drive.

Can have databases that link to your google sheets, or docs, or slides - as there are many things that make sense to not live in Notion. 

Especially in the remote world - we have so many collaboration tools, and data lives in so many places. 

The number of applications I use every day can almost seem overwhelming

- Google Docs
- Google Sheets
- Google Drive
- Google Slides
- Namely
- Office Vibe
- Trello
- Slack
- Lever 
- Jira
- Otter
- Miro
- Figma
- Loom
- etc

and I'm probably missing a few - and for some people, it's probably more. 

Often in my notes - I'll create attributes for links to jira, otter, etc - so when I'm going back to that note, I can quickly access links that I need.

There are lots of things that can live in notion - lots of notes, documentation, meeting note type of needs can fit well in notion, and the extra formatting/etc of Google Docs isn't needed. 

But - lots of things do live better outside of Notion - when you build it as a hub that makes those other resources easier to find and navigate, especially for people who are new to the company and team, is when you start to get a lot of value.


# Baaaaah

[[Info Dump]] much? ..... enough about notes at work, well - at least in the context of work. Cause, I feel like talking a bit about how I've been learning how to make my notes work for me.

# Making my notes work for me

Because, I already have a bit of an example, because a few days ago I had written about watching [[The Playbook - EP3 - Watching Notes|The Playbook]], and writing down some notes along with it. 

I'm facilitating a group discussion about it at the end of the week - so, already have some notes prepared, and have those copied over into my work vault. 

Then - even after that, I got thinking about Rule 6.

> 6. Don't Coach the Player, coach the Team 

[[Coach The Team Not The Player - adapting to change]] - and reflecting on some of the differences I've had being a manager at Rangle, and being a manager at PartnerStack.

Then there was the notes from the [[21-02-02 - Driving Change How to Create a More Equitable and Inclusive Workspace|Driving Change How to Create a More Equitable and Inclusive Workspace]]

The idea of [[Interview Out vs Interview In]] really got my attention, and also reminds me a bit of some of the challenges I've had hiring senior engineers in the past. 

A bit of that is - can they still be coached?

### Interviewing In, and Technical Interviews 

It also reminded me of a good article by [[@laurieontech]] - [Senior Interviews != Three Junior Interviews In a Trench Coat](https://laurieontech.com/posts/senior-interviews/) - and identifies some of the pitfalls that we can fall into when interviewing for senior roles. 

I've made this mistake in the past myself - applying the same approach as a junior interview to a senior interview, and it just doesn't work. There are very different skill sets that I'm looking for.  

So, now when thinking about Interviewing In, Inclusive Interviewing, and the differences between interviewing for junior and senior.

- What considerations do we need for Interviewing In for junior?
- What considerations do we need for Interviewing In for senior?
- What supports do we need to provide for them to be successful once joining?
- What does this look like in a remote-first world?

I don't know the answers to these - but it's something that's on my mind, and I'll probably continue to expand on in this journal. 

## Interviews - Don't Be Ableist

I've also written about [[the difficulties of adjusting to remote work while Neurodiverse]] quite a bit, some of those notes are not collected into here (yet)

But I also have lots of tweets about my experience having a stutter, how it's impacted work, about how ND people are impacted by remote work - both good and bad.

Interviews can be particularly challenging for ND people, and often - aspects of the remote video interview can just make things worse. 

For example, I have a stutter - and it can have a big impact on how I am perceived, and some of the issues with video make it worse.

### Did I stutter, or did Zoom Freeze?

If I had a dollar for everytime someone has asked "you there? did zoom freeze" - when I was stuck on a word, I'd be rich.

> Zoom didn't freeze - I have a stutter.

There are days when I am totally fluent, and it doesn't take much effort - and have no problem talking.

Then there are days, that are just bad mouth days. I get tongue tied, and can't even say my name to the Barrista taking my name for my coffee order.

[[Irionally - my own name is a sound I consistently get stuck on]], which can make introductions pretty awkward at times, but I digress.

During interviews now - regardless of which side of the table I'm on - I'll usually comment that I have a stutter, and occasionally get stuck on words. 

#### Breaking the Tension

And also say - If there is something that you didn't understand - feel free to ask me to repeat it, I don't mind.

As at times with my speech impediment - I can also cluster words, repeat sounds - and yeah, at times when listening to my own voice back, I have no idea what I said either.

There have been enough times in my life, where I've seen the discomfort in someones face as they wait for me to force out a sound, or the look of confusion when it comes out in a mess that they can't understand.

I'd really prefer that they just ask me to repeat myself, but also - once this is out of the way, it's also a bit easier to leverage on some of the techniques that I use to manage my speech. 

### I'm not unknowledgeable or lying, I have a stutter 

Some of the common things that I've heard people look for, to try and see if someone is lying, or if they are taking a wild guess at answering a question - are some of the same things I do because I stutter.

I might have a long pause before starting to answer.

I know what I want to say, I know how I want to say it - but for some reason, the words just won't come out. 

Or, I know that there are certain sounds in how I would answer it that might give me a problem, so I'm re-arranging sentences in my head into ones that hopefully I won't stutter on.

I might get partway through a sentence and then get stuck on a word, and then sort of need to do a rewind and re-start - some people read this repeating of words, as reaching for words because I'm not really sure.

At times I'll touch my forehead to think for a moment, and that hesitation and delay helps me get into a response. 

- Sometimes that's read as me being thoughtful
- Sometimes that's read as me trying to come up with a lie

Eye contact is also uncomfortable for me - I might not always be making eye contact. 

There also times where if I'm getting stuck on something, I'll end up just literally saying "blah blahb blergg", and do some sort of vocal / mental reset and start over.

If I'm having a bad mouth day during an interview, ouf. 

But, at the same time - I've done alot of [[Public Speaking]] and really enjoy it. 

When I've had the opportunity to travel to Barcelona to speak about [[How to create Vuetiful Data-Driven User Interface - JSCamp 2018]],  but I could still totally have an off day during an interview.

I'm also ADHD - and might fidget a bit, eye contact can get uncomfortable at times - and with the slight lag / video quality / quirks of video calls - reading expressions is taking so much more effort. 

Zoom has been a kind of neurodiverse sensory hell for me, and when slight pauses get read as zoom freezing - bleh.

I think I'm starting to loose my point here, but that's kind of the point of the ramble actually.

# So, what is [[The Evening Ramble]] all about?

This site as a whole, will be some sort of digital garden.

The evening ramble is the train of thought space, and not going to get too hung up on the structure of things.

Just the working train of thought for the evening. 

Then over time - do a review later, and start pulling things out into more refined notes later on. 

[[I remember when]] I was using Roam, I had gotten into the habit of creating pages for certain phrases like [[expand on]], or [[like to]].

I did this because of the feature of being able to find unlinked backreferences, which is basically just a search on that same keyword, and shows it in a different group.

What makes it useful though, is if I'm writing notes about something - there is certian language that I tend to use naturally.

So, if I was to say that this is an idea that I would like to expand on, how I would use this and look for sentences that had [[expand on]] in them.

![[Screen Shot 2021-02-03 at 9.25.39 PM.png]]

if I'm looking for ideas - I can pick out those key words - and start creating and organizing my thoughts around those.

## How I use this for work

Bah, back to work stuff.  But one of the ways that I use [[obsidian at work]], is having keywords for things like

- [[kyle -- feedback]]

And when I am in the middle of writing a meeting note in here.

### In My Meeting Notes

#### Meeting Notes

- Blah blah blah, 
- The TPS was well done, [[kyle -- feedback]] - he did a really great job at the thing that he did. 


Or maybe I noticed them going out of their way to hel

### Or even in just my daily work log.

- [[kyle -- feedback]] - noticed they went out of their way to help so and so.]

# Feedback Time

Then it's time for feedback - and well, feedback should be ongoing - and usually after I write down the note about feedback -> I give them that feedback.

Or, I give them that feedback - and then write it down in here. 

When it's time to do a performance review, and provide more formal feedback - I can look through everything taged [[kyle -- feedback]], and start to collect notes that way.

I'll aso often save a link along to the slack thread / conversation, the meeting note related.

It helps retain so much context - I can see the comment in my notes, jump to the slack thread - read the rest of the conversation, gain the context around that. 

# Slack Eats History

As much as I love slack for some things, I hate slack for so many other things.  Everything is real-time urgency in the chat.  So much information get's lost in chat history - but it's not saved anywhere else. 

## I'll copy slack threads into my notes

I don't copy everything over - but sometimes there are discussions that feel like they justify a meetings note.

It's not something I'm inclined to make a google doc for, but I'll copy it over here.

I'll remember that I talked to Kyle on Slack about X - check my notes here first, and then that's linked to all sorts of other things.


The slack message could be mentioning an update on [[The Project]] - and I can quickly find all of my other notes about The Project.


# [[I don't trust my brain, but I trust my notes]].

For the longest time before I was diagnosed as ADHD - I always felt like my problem was that I just needed to remember better. Like it was a matter of willpower, and I was just choosing to not remember. 

Things like test dates, and exam dates, and friends birthdays - you should just remember them if you care, right?

It felt like it was some sort of personal failure that I just couldn't remember better.

What I've been learning to do - is helping me build systems to help with recall. 

# Oh, so I don't forget

[[That Time I walked 42km in one day]]

![[42k WALKING ROUTE.jpeg]]

[[When good notes made my Vue Talk really easy]]
- I was between projects at work,  and the previous one was all Angular. There were large parts of their application that needed to generate parts of it's UI from an API response - dynamic forms, etc.
- I was wanting to learn more about Vue at the time - I had done a few small things with it, and it looked really appealing but I hadn't built anything serious with it yet.
- Once I learned the basics - I wanted to try and see how I would solve the problem with Vue, that was really a pain in the ass with angular at the time.
- I took good notes along the way
- turned that into a blog
- turned that into a conference talk
- the goal of the article though wasn't to be 'hey here use my library', but help people make things like that really easy.
-
