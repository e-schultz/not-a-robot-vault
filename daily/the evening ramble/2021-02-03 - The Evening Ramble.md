# 2021-02-03 - [[The Evening Ramble]]

Today was a pretty good day actually - it feels like I'm starting to get out of a bit of the funk that I had hit after the holidays, but - there will be up's and downs, so enjoy that I enjoyed today - but don't get all grumpy if I'm grumpy tomorrow. 

# First day in awhile that I've enjoyed going for a walk

Getting outside and going for walks is one of the most important things for self-care that I can do for myself, and when weather + pandemic really starts to limit how viable, and/or enjoyable that is - does not make me a very happy person.

Eaarlier in the week I went for a longish walk because I had to go see my doctor for a [[study visit for the medical trial]]  that I am on, but I was groggy in the morning - the weather wasn't nice, and it felt like a slog - not something that I enjoyed

I've almost stopped paying attention to the weather forecasts - but today during standup at work, someone had mentioned that today was going to be above 0 and sunny in the afternoon - and we encouraged everyone to get outside and go for a walk later in the day if possible.[^1t]

At around lunch, bundled up - but not too warm, and went for a bit of a graffiti walk around where I live, and it was nice to actually feel the sun for the first time in awhile.

# Photos for Video Art Fodder

Had a nice vibe to kick off the walk with. Made a quick [TikTok video with some of the art along the way](https://www.tiktok.com/@evan.just.ev4n/video/6925161132181196038?is_copy_url=0&is_from_webapp=v1&sender_device=pc&sender_web_id=6832640840113718790) once I got back home.

I took one of the photos that was saved as a live photo, converted it to a video - did some edits with Hyperspektive - and now building up bits of my video loop library.

## Knowledge Management 

When I worked at Rangle, I had helped with the initial adoption of Notion - starting out more as a tech knowledge base, and then got adopted company wide. 

We used it for tracking blog content, guild meetings, some internal projects, I had also used it quite a bit for managing my 1:1 meetings. 

When I started at PartnerStack - I think only the design team was using Notion, I had setup my own personal account to try and manage my work notes in - but at the time, I was wanting something quick and fast - and was finding that Notion was causing me friction. 

## Personal vs Collaborative Knowledge Management 

This is when I started to use RoamResearch - initially it had started out as me basically using it like an Notes entry on the daily pages, and over time - built up quite a robust [[personal knowledge management]] system.

Since there wasn't mass adoption of Notion at work yet, there was some stuff scattered around confluence, and a bunch of things in Google Drive, shared google docs, and things buried in the history of slack.

So basically, I decided to embrace the chaos - and used Roam to build my own kind of second brain - my notes became my working memory, that contained links to all of the other locations things were shared.

If I had a one on one meeting - and we had a google shared doc for it, I'd copy/paste the meeting notes into my own system, a link to the shared doc.

# Baaaaah

[[Info Dump]] much? ..... enough about notes at work, well - at least in the context of work. Cause, I feel like talking a bit about how I've been learning how to make my notes work for me.

# Making my notes work for me

Because, I already have a bit of an example, because a few days ago I had written about watching [[The Playbook - EP3 - Watching Notes|The Playbook]], and writing down some notes along with it. 

I'm facilitating a group discussion about it at the end of the week - so, already have some notes prepared, and have those copied over into my work vault. 

Then - even after that, I got thinking about Rule 6.

> 6. Don't Coach the Player, coach the Team 

[[Coach The Team Not The Player - adapting to change]] - and reflecting on some of the differences I've had being a manager at Rangle, and being a manager at PartnerStack.

Then there was the notes from the [[21-02-02 - Driving Change How to Create a More Equitable and Inclusive Workspace|Driving Change How to Create a More Equitable and Inclusive Workspace]]

The idea of [[Interview Out vs Interview In]] really got my attention, and also reminds me a bit of some of the challenges I've had hiring senior engineers in the past. 

A bit of that is - can they still be coached?

### Interviewing In, and Technical Interviews 

It also reminded me of a good article by [[@laurieontech]] - [Senior Interviews != Three Junior Interviews In a Trench Coat](https://laurieontech.com/posts/senior-interviews/) - and identifies some of the pitfalls that we can fall into when interviewing for senior roles. 

I've made this mistake in the past myself - applying the same approach as a junior interview to a senior interview, and it just doesn't work. There are very different skill sets that I'm looking for.  

So, now when thinking about Interviewing In, Inclusive Interviewing, and the differences between interviewing for junior and senior.

- What considerations do we need for Interviewing In for junior?
- What considerations do we need for Interviewing In for senior?
- What supports do we need to provide for them to be successful once joining?
- What does this look like in a remote-first world?

I don't know the answers to these - but it's something that's on my mind, and I'll probably continue to expand on in this journal. 

## Interviews - Don't Be Ableist
- [[Abelism]]
I've also written about [[the difficulties of adjusting to remote work while Neurodiverse]] quite a bit, some of those notes are not collected into here (yet)

But I also have lots of tweets about my experience having a stutter, how it's impacted work, about how ND people are impacted by remote work - both good and bad.

Interviews can be particularly challenging for ND people, and often - aspects of the remote video interview can just make things worse. 

For example, I have a stutter - and it can have a big impact on how I am perceived, and some of the issues with video make it worse.

### Did I stutter, or did Zoom Freeze?

If I had a dollar for every time someone has asked "you there? did zoom freeze" - when I was stuck on a word, I'd be rich.

> Zoom didn't freeze - I have a stutter.

There are days when I am totally fluent, and it doesn't take much effort - and have no problem talking.

Then there are days, that are just bad mouth days. I get tongue tied, and can't even say my name to the Barista taking my name for my coffee order.

[[Irionally - my own name is a sound I consistently get stuck on]], which can make introductions pretty awkward at times, but I digress.

During interviews now - regardless of which side of the table I'm on - I'll usually comment that I have a stutter, and occasionally get stuck on words. 

#### Breaking the Tension

And also say - If there is something that you didn't understand - feel free to ask me to repeat it, I don't mind.

As at times with my speech impediment - I can also cluster words, repeat sounds - and yeah, at times when listening to my own voice back, I have no idea what I said either.

There have been enough times in my life, where I've seen the discomfort in someones face as they wait for me to force out a sound, or the look of confusion when it comes out in a mess that they can't understand.

I'd really prefer that they just ask me to repeat myself, but also - once this is out of the way, it's also a bit easier to leverage on some of the techniques that I use to manage my speech. 

### I'm not unknowledgeable or lying, I have a stutter 

Some of the common things that I've heard people look for, to try and see if someone is lying, or if they are taking a wild guess at answering a question - are some of the same things I do because I stutter.

I might have a long pause before starting to answer.

I know what I want to say, I know how I want to say it - but for some reason, the words just won't come out. 

Or, I know that there are certain sounds in how I would answer it that might give me a problem, so I'm re-arranging sentences in my head into ones that hopefully I won't stutter on.

I might get partway through a sentence and then get stuck on a word, and then sort of need to do a rewind and re-start - some people read this repeating of words, as reaching for words because I'm not really sure.

At times I'll touch my forehead to think for a moment, and that hesitation and delay helps me get into a response. 

- Sometimes that's read as me being thoughtful
- Sometimes that's read as me trying to come up with a lie

Eye contact is also uncomfortable for me - I might not always be making eye contact. 

There also times where if I'm getting stuck on something, I'll end up just literally saying "blah blahb blergg", and do some sort of vocal / mental reset and start over.

If I'm having a bad mouth day during an interview, ouf. 

But, at the same time - I've done allot of [[Public Speaking]] and really enjoy it. 

When I've had the opportunity to travel to Barcelona to speak about [[How to create Vuetiful Data-Driven User Interface - JSCamp 2018]],  but I could still totally have an off day during an interview.

I'm also ADHD - and might fidget a bit, eye contact can get uncomfortable at times - and with the slight lag / video quality / quirks of video calls - reading expressions is taking so much more effort. 

Zoom has been a kind of neurodiverse sensory hell for me, and when slight pauses get read as zoom freezing - bleh.

I think I'm starting to loose my point here, but that's kind of the point of the ramble actually.

# So, what is [[The Evening Ramble]] all about?

This site as a whole, will be some sort of digital garden.

The evening ramble is the train of thought space, and not going to get too hung up on the structure of things.

Just the working train of thought for the evening. 

Then over time - do a review later, and start pulling things out into more refined notes later on. 

[[I remember when]] I was using Roam, I had gotten into the habit of creating pages for certain phrases like [[expand on]], or [[like to]].

I did this because of the feature of being able to find unlinked backreferences, which is basically just a search on that same keyword, and shows it in a different group.

What makes it useful though, is if I'm writing notes about something - there is certian language that I tend to use naturally.

So, if I was to say that this is an idea that I would like to expand on, how I would use this and look for sentences that had [[expand on]] in them.

![[Screen Shot 2021-02-03 at 9.25.39 PM.png]]

if I'm looking for ideas - I can pick out those key words - and start creating and organizing my thoughts around those.

## How I use this for work

Bah, back to work stuff.  But one of the ways that I use [[obsidian at work]], is having keywords for things like

- [[kyle -- feedback]]

And when I am in the middle of writing a meeting note in here.

### In My Meeting Notes

#### Meeting Notes

- Blah blah blah, 
- The TPS was well done, [[kyle -- feedback]] - he did a really great job at the thing that he did. 


Or maybe I noticed them going out of their way to hel

### Or even in just my daily work log.

- [[kyle -- feedback]] - noticed they went out of their way to help so and so.]

# Feedback Time

Then it's time for feedback - and well, feedback should be ongoing - and usually after I write down the note about feedback -> I give them that feedback.

Or, I give them that feedback - and then write it down in here. 

When it's time to do a performance review, and provide more formal feedback - I can look through everything tagged [[kyle -- feedback]], and start to collect notes that way.

I'll also often save a link along to the slack thread / conversation, the meeting note related.

It helps retain so much context - I can see the comment in my notes, jump to the slack thread - read the rest of the conversation, gain the context around that. 

# Slack Eats History

As much as I love slack for some things, I hate slack for so many other things.  Everything is real-time urgency in the chat.  So much information get's lost in chat history - but it's not saved anywhere else. 

## I'll copy slack threads into my notes

I don't copy everything over - but sometimes there are discussions that feel like they justify a meetings note.

It's not something I'm inclined to make a google doc for, but I'll copy it over here.

I'll remember that I talked to Kyle on Slack about X - check my notes here first, and then that's linked to all sorts of other things.


The slack message could be mentioning an update on [[The Project]] - and I can quickly find all of my other notes about The Project.

[[When good notes made my Vue Talk really easy]]
- I was between projects at work,  and the previous one was all Angular. There were large parts of their application that needed to generate parts of it's UI from an API response - dynamic forms, etc.
- I was wanting to learn more about Vue at the time - I had done a few small things with it, and it looked really appealing but I hadn't built anything serious with it yet.
- Once I learned the basics - I wanted to try and see how I would solve the problem with Vue, that was really a pain in the ass with angular at the time.
- I took good notes along the way
- turned that into a blog
- turned that into a conference talk
- the goal of the article though wasn't to be 'hey here use my library', but help people make things like that really easy.
