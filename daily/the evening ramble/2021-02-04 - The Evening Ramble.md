# Resisting the Urge to Import

Every time I start a new vault, library, or using a note taking app / knowledge management system - [[202102231835 Why I resist the urge to bulk import into new knowledge management systems|there is a part of me that wants to do a bulk import of everything that I have written before.]]

# Write about what you are interested in

When I was in a more regular writing routine, even if it was mostly for myself - it was writing about things that were top of mind, things that I was interested in, comments on an article / book / video I had just watched.

Maybe something from twitter got me thinking, maybe a useful seminar or podcast.

Then, when for example - I have a bunch of twitter threads saved to [[Readwise]] - when I use readwise, it surfaces up tweets, highlights from books, things I've grabbed from the web - I tend to take notes on those if they are interesting, or discard them. 

This is how I start to build things up over time.

## Note Review 

One of the mistakes I think people make with note-taking, is not getting into a good note review habit - we tend to think of notes as 'done' once we hit save, and not often go back. 

There are a lot of reasons for that - they are in multiple files, scattered around, maybe shared with other people, not linked to other documents, difficult to find, etc.

This is where having a combination of

- a set time for review
- making use of things like the random note feature
- making use of mentions
- making use of Unlinked mentions 
- etc

### Making use of Mentions

I think I wrote about this last night, especially when I tend to use works like

- would like to
- expand on
- interested in
- thinking about

This is an interesting way to surface up stuff that I'm well, actively thinking about. 

However, I also write about topics that cause certain words to appear in my writing frequently 

- ADHD
- neurodiverse
- neurodivergent
- diversity 
- DEI
- tech
- writing
- interviews
- etc

One of the handy thing about Obsidian, is when I setup a page with aliases - is that the aliases will get pulled in with the Unlinked mentions as well.

So for example, I just created a page called [[neurodivergent]], and added a few aliases:

![[ND Aliases Screen Shot 2021-02-04 at 6.14.59 PM.png]]

#### Linked and Unlinked 

When browsing this on the web as a published site, you will only see the linked mentions on that page. 

However, when using the application - I will also see the Unlinked mentions.

#### Sorting and Context

I can also

- sort them by name
- created date
- modified date

I can also have some element of control over how much content around that word is displayed.

### This surfaces notes

I might then dive into those notes - and maybe explicitly link them, or it might inspire me to write more about it.

### Expanding Notes

Maybe seeing this pop up got me thinking about [[neurodiverse microaggressions]] and dealing with being bullied as a kid.

### Kind of like quote tweeting yourself

I could make use of a referencing a specific line of text - kind of like quote-tweeting myself.

Currently - don't like how Obsidian is formatting those inline, but meh - I'll tweak the CSS later. 

But, alot of these things that have had a big impact on me, especially while undiagnosed - really informed how I acted as a kid, how I learned to behave, and have carried through into adulthood. 

Now as I'm having a better understanding of these things, and working as a manager - and have people reporting to me who could also be neurodiverse, it has influenced how I approach management, performance, encouraging people, etc. 

## Pull things in when ready 

So, as I was writing that out - it reminded me of this tweet thread I wrote on being a [[neurodiverse manager]]

### The Tweet  Thread

#### [[@evan_just_evan]] on being a [[neurodiverse manager]] 

[tweet[(https://twitter.com/evan_just_evan/status/1354785613321543681) by [[@evan_just_evan]] on [[2021-01-28]] - [[tweet threads]] on [[neurodivergent|neurodiversity]]

Being [#neurodiverse](https://twitter.com/hashtag/neurodiverse?src=hashtag_click) and also working in tech, now as an [#manager](https://twitter.com/hashtag/manager?src=hashtag_click) - it's interesting to see how others work, ND and NT. I do need to be mindful of not projecting my own experience onto others.  [^1ndm]

I do need to be mindful of not projecting my own experience onto others. 

But when I see things happen that may make someone else think that a person is being  
  
- lazy  
- careless  
- not paying attention to detail  
- unmotivated  
- not trying hard enough  
  
My default tends to be - don't assume it's a fault of the person. 

I've been on the receiving end of comments like that all my life, and know how frustrating it is to be dismissed as lazy or careless - especially when I've put in so much effort, and tried to be extra carefull. 

- Is it the team dynamics?  
- Unclear priorities?  
- Not sure where to start?  
- Unclear stories / requirements?  
  
Has something been communicated from a NT loaded with assumptions that other people should "just get"?

Are they not comfortable asking for help / support / clarification because all through school and thier career having people getting frustrated with them for "not just getting it" 

Is there a mix of smaller bite sized work that can be picked off to help build momentum too go into the larger tasks? 

Did they Hyperfocus and get like 80% of it done A but now hitting Hyperfocus burnout / fatigue - and getting the last details done is proving to be near impossible - and what support can be provided. 

How do they process information - do they need time with something on thier own before discussing it in a larger setting? 

Context switching and multi-tasking is hard for most people, but can be especially disruptive for [#neurodiverse](https://threadreaderapp.com/hashtag/neurodiverse) people  

- are they getting enough heads down time?  
- Do they keep getting pulled in other directions?  
- has meeting overwhelm taken over? 

Do they do their best work / focus at odd hours - but feel pressure to be "on" from 9-5?  
  
Do they feel / know that they can have autonomy to pick up some other things - even if it's not top priority, but helps point them in that direction. 

Learning to become a good manager is hard, and it takes time - and still figuring things out.  
  
But - I don't know many managers / leadership in tech that are ND, or if they are - are not public about it.

It can be scary to be open about this at work - especially if not one above you is being open about it either.  
  
It would be really nice to find other managers /leadership roles / C-suite / directors that are ND be more open about it.
