# Resisting the Urge to Import

Every time I start a new vault, library, or using a note taking app / knowledge management system - there is a part of me that wants to do a bulk import of everything that I have written before. 

And considering how much stuff I have scattered around - it is, alot - especially when I have been using apps like [[Readwise]], [[Instapaper]], having things sycned with [[Goodreads]], [[Notion]], etc ---- I have an abundance of content that I could just bulk import all at once.

But, I think I shall resist that urge - and let this grow a bit more organically over time, and since I do have lots of stuff written in other places - and can find it pretty easily, pull it over as it makes sense.

# Write about what you are interested in

When I was in a more regular writing routine, even if it was mostly for myself - it was writing about things that were top of mind, things that I was interested in, comments on an article / book / video I had just watched.

Maybe something from twitter got me thinking, maybe a useful seminar or podcast.

Then, when for example - I have a bunch of twitter threads saved to [[Readwise]] - when I use readwise, it surfaces up tweets, highlights from books, things I've grabbed from the web - I tend to take notes on those if they are interesting, or discard them. 

This is how I start to build things up over time.

## Note Review 

One of the mistakes I think people make with note-taking, is not getting into a good note review habit - we tend to think of notes as 'done' once we hit save, and not often go back. 

There are a lot of reasons for that - they are in multiple files, scattered around, maybe shared with other people, not linked to other documents, difficult to find, etc.

This is where having a combination of

- a set time for review
- making use of things like the random note feature
- making use of mentions
- making use of Unlinked mentions 
- etc

### Making use of Mentions

I think I wrote about this last night, especially when I tend to use works like

- would like to
- expand on
- interested in
- thinking about

This is an interesting way to surface up stuff that I'm well, actively thinking about. 

However, I also write about topics that cause certain words to appear in my writing frequently 

- ADHD
- neurodiverse
- neurodivergent
- diversity 
- DEI
- tech
- writing
- interviews
- etc

One of the handy thing about Obsidian, is when I setup a page with aliases - is that the aliases will get pulled in with the Unlinked mentions as well.

So for example, I just created a page called [[neurodivergent]], and added a few aliases:

![[ND Aliases Screen Shot 2021-02-04 at 6.14.59 PM.png]]

#### Linked and Unlinked 

When browsing this on the web as a published site, you will only see the linked mentions on that page. 

However, when using the application - I will also see the Unlinked mentions.

![[ND - Linked and Unlinked Mentions Screen Shot 2021-02-04 at 6.17.22 PM.png]]

#### Sorting and Context

I can also

- sort them by name
- created date
- modified date

I can also have some element of control over how much content around that word is displayed.

![[ND - unlinked - expanded - Screen Shot 2021-02-04 at 6.18.51 PM.png]]

### This surfaces notes

I might then dive into those notes - and maybe explicitly link them, or it might inspire me to write more about it.

### Expanding Notes

Maybe seeing this pop up got me thinking about [[neurodiverse microaggressions]] and dealing with being bullied as a kid.

### Kind of like quote tweeting yourself

I could make use of a referencing a specific line of text - kind of like quote-tweeting myself.

![[1356571318020431872 - Getting in trouble and not knowing why#^526008]]

--- 

Currently - don't like how Obsidian is formatting those inline, but meh - I'll tweak the CSS later. 

But, alot of these things that have had a big impact on me, especially while undiagnosed - really informed how I acted as a kid, how I learned to behave, and have carried through into adulthood. 

Now as I'm having a better understanding of these things, and working as a manager - and have people reporting to me who could also be neurodiverse, it has influenced how I approach management, performance, encouraging people, etc. 

## Pull things in when ready 

So, as I was writing that out - it reminded me of this tweet thread I wrote on being a [[neurodiverse manager]]

### The Tweet  Thread

#### [[@evan_just_evan]] on being a [[neurodiverse manager]] 

[tweet[(https://twitter.com/evan_just_evan/status/1354785613321543681) by [[@evan_just_evan]] on [[2021-01-28]] - [[tweet threads]] on [[neurodivergent|neurodiversity]]

Being [#neurodiverse](https://twitter.com/hashtag/neurodiverse?src=hashtag_click) and also working in tech, now as an [#manager](https://twitter.com/hashtag/manager?src=hashtag_click) - it's interesting to see how others work, ND and NT. I do need to be mindful of not projecting my own experience onto others.  [^1ndm]

[^1ndm]:[[neurodivergent|neurodiverse]] [[manager]]

I do need to be mindful of not projecting my own experience onto others. 

But when I see things happen that may make someone else think that a person is being  
  
- lazy  
- careless  
- not paying attention to detail  
- unmotivated  
- not trying hard enough  
  
My default tends to be - don't assume it's a fault of the person. 

I've been on the receiving end of comments like that all my life, and know how frustrating it is to be dismissed as lazy or careless - especially when I've put in so much effort, and tried to be extra carefull. 

- Is it the team dynamics?  
- Unclear priorities?  
- Not sure where to start?  
- Unclear stories / requirements?  
  
Has something been communicated from a NT loaded with assumptions that other people should "just get"?

Are they not comfortable asking for help / support / clarification because all through school and thier career having people getting frustrated with them for "not just getting it" 

Is there a mix of smaller bite sized work that can be picked off to help build momentum too go into the larger tasks? 

Did they Hyperfocus and get like 80% of it done A but now hitting Hyperfocus burnout / fatigue - and getting the last details done is proving to be near impossible - and what support can be provided. 

How do they process information - do they need time with something on thier own before discussing it in a larger setting? 

Context switching and multi-tasking is hard for most people, but can be especially disruptive for [#neurodiverse](https://threadreaderapp.com/hashtag/neurodiverse) people  

- are they getting enough heads down time?  
- Do they keep getting pulled in other directions?  
- has meeting overwhelm taken over? 

Do they do their best work / focus at odd hours - but feel pressure to be "on" from 9-5?  
  
Do they feel / know that they can have autonomy to pick up some other things - even if it's not top priority, but helps point them in that direction. 

Learning to become a good manager is hard, and it takes time - and still figuring things out.  
  
But - I don't know many managers / leadership in tech that are ND, or if they are - are not public about it.

It can be scary to be open about this at work - especially if not one above you is being open about it either.  
  
It would be really nice to find other managers /leadership roles / C-suite / directors that are ND be more open about it. 

It's probably mean alot to the people working for you.

## Sticking to my own rules 

Part of me wants to go and spend time putting this note over into the tweet-threads section of [[@evan_just_evan]] - but that can break a bit of the flow of writing, and especially when the purpose of the ramble, is to well - ramble.

# Fear of the Blank Page

One of the biggest challenges I can have when I want to write about something, is having a blank page - I might know I want to write about this or that, but if I open up a google doc, or some online CMS and have just a blank text-box looking back at me, it can be intimidating.

But, when writing is how you work - and not an afterthought to how you work,  a lot of the initial writing has already been done for you.

## [[🌱 Make use of whats on the editing room floor]]

A mistake that I've done in the past, especially if I've gotten over the fear of the blank page - is as I'm preparing to write something, I'll take all sorts of rough notes. 

I'll collect extra resources, write down way more information than what makes it into the final copy, and I might go explore rabbit holes on other topics along the way. 

Then, I make my final copy, hit save, publish it somewhere - and then all of those [[working notes]] get tossed away - and never used again. 

Once we learn to keep those around, treat them as living things - tweak and edit, connect to other ideas, grow them over time - they can become the source for other material over time.

## Fleeting vs Permanent 

In the book [[📰 - How to Take Smart Notes]] - they talk about fleeting notes, project notes, permanent notes, etc -and there is a difference between these, and the value they can have, and how they can be used.

If you have piles of journals, or dozens of google docs - that you never go back to, rarely refer to, and has basically been just a 'braindump to offload your memory' and never return to, and find that making your notes valuable is hard - this is the mistake of treating every note as a permanent note, even though those are more of your fleeting notes.

Basically - everything under this daily note / morning pages / evening ramble is a bunch of fleeting notes. 

Eventually I'll start to refine ideas - and maybe make smaller notes, concept anchors, atomic notes that capture key thoughts - and link them to other notes.

It might not be a big essay, or a blog post, or an article yet - but it's lifting things out of this stream of consciousness, and making them a bit more concrete.

Then over time - when I want to write more in-depth on a topic, like maybe one day I want to actually write an article on [[Feedback Advice for Neurodiverse Employees]] (which I do want to do at some point ) #tk 

I can skim these fleeting notes and tag things, start turning them into outlines, look at my smaller atomic notes or seedlings or whatever note taxonomy I decide to go with - and start pulling in information from what i've already written.

A large part of the work is already done.

## Leveling The Playing Field for Different Neurotypes

via [[@MissAmyTobey]] - [tweet](https://twitter.com/MissAmyTobey/status/1357475385177378816)

> high autonomy culture levels the playing field for different neurotypes. some folks can produce on a schedule. some folks (me) build stuff in fits, starts, and tsunamis. some are great at thinking on their feet, others need solitude and quiet. we need everyone [^1ma]

## Isolation has me wondering what was anxiety vs sensory processing issues

forgot I wrote this this morning, 

> -  I'm wondering how many times what I was thinking anxiety was me l needing a quiet dim rooms, but not able to access one easily.
> -   Now thats my quiet dim room is feet away and available all day... [twitter.com/elisekumar/sta…](https://twitter.com/elisekumar/status/1357212563356852226)

moved to -> [[202102212320 Isolation has me wondering what was anxiety vs sensory processing issues]]
## Elise Kumar got me thinking about it.

[[Neurodiverse Twitter]]does get me self reflecting a lot, but nothing wrong with that.

**Elise tweeted:**
 
> Wondering how much of my “anxiety” is actually sensory processing issues. Thinking about going to the butcher seems fine. Am fine right up until I get to the door and then I walk away because I can’t tell if it’s open or not because I can’t process the signage. - [@elisekumar](https://twitter.com/elisekumar/status/1357212563356852226) [^22eli] [^anxietyvssensory]

## Alternatives to Clean Code 

Uncle Bob is problematic, and it's pretty common that his books Clean Code, and Clean Architecture get recommended. 

However, [Tech Bullshit Explained: Uncle Bob](https://techexplained.substack.com/p/tech-bullshit-explained-uncle-bob)[^tbe] goes into a few of the reasons why he's a problem.


[^tbe]: [[@melissamcewen]]  [tweeted](https://twitter.com/melissamcewen/status/1280587324863270912) a link to her article 

So, it's not that uncommon that you [see people asking for alternative books](https://twitter.com/HarleenQuinzell/status/1357259882198622214) pretty often. 

Awhile ago [[@dev_nikema]] [tweeted](https://twitter.com/dev_nikema/status/1350233517137907713) asking the question:

> If someone wanted to get Clean Code but would like to avoid uncle B6b, what alternative would you recommend? Someone is not me. I mentioned The Pragmatic Programmer but I haven't gone through it yet. I'm not familiar with Clean Code either so I don't know if they are comparable - [dev_nikema](https://twitter.com/dev_nikema/status/1350233517137907713) 

Some really good suggestions in that thread.



## My Dislike of WebForms is why I learned JavaScript

@davidfowl [tweeted](https://twitter.com/davidfowl/status/1357464354048921602) about what was your programming language journey, and it reminded me of mine. 

- [Tweet](https://twitter.com/i/status/1357493184423731200) by [@evan_just_evan](https://twitter.com/evan_just_evan) on [[2021-01-04]]
- I hated the UpdatePanel / partial page updates on WebForms so much, it was a big motivator to start learning JavaScript.
  - "Why do I need to do a partial postback in an update panel on a WebForm to add two damn numbers" [twitter.com/evan_just_evan…](https://twitter.com/evan_just_evan/status/1357492684286476290)
- and once I figured out how to expose methods as 'Page Methods' or whatever they called them, and make AJAX requests to it for things where I did need information from the server.
  - 'making ASP WebForms not suck" was my main motivation.
- it served me well.

# Was going to write a thing

.... but then I forgot, 

Oh - I think it was something along the lines of, need to consider the different ways that people appreciate recognition.

recognition can mean different things for different people - both in what it means to them, and how they want / recognized when it's being delivered.

Also - being aware of what types of behavior gets people noticed, and the biases it may inform. 

People can contribute in so many ways, but if you only reward and promote those that are very extroverted - you are excluding entire groups of people.
