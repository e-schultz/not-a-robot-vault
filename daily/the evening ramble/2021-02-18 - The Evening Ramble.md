# 2021-02-18 - [[The Evening Ramble]]

# End of Work Thoughts
- today was a pretty busy day
- lots of back to back meetings - got a bit brain-zonked by the end of it
- Getting inspired by how Facts & Snacks / Learning Hub / Teaching efforts are going
- Played around with some Vue Unit testing at the end of day for a quick proof of concept on testing route guards beyond verifying that next has been called.

# Reading Inbox Cleanup
	
I tend to save a lot of things to [Refind](https://refind.com/evan-schultz), it's a mix of things that I've read, might find useful, or been meaning to read.
	
Usually if an article is something I want to read and take notes on, I'll end up using [Instapaper](https://www.instapaper.com/), or [hypothes.is](https://hypothes.is) 
	
This lets me highlight, add notes, etc as I'm reading along. Usually when I highlight - I try add a little note/context to why I found it useful, although now and then I do highlight without commenting. 
	
These then get sucked up into Readwise for me to review later, and over time - those things end up here. 
	
## Starting the February 2021 Reads collection

SInce refined tends to be my 'catch all' - was wanting to also start grouping the articles that I've actually read, and read also usually means at least a few notes along with it as well.

So dug through stuff I had in Instapaper with notes, and started to populated my [2021 - February Reads collection](https://refind.com/evan-schultz/2021---february-reads)

I'm missing a few as of right now, but currently have 25 things there - and most of those I've taken quite a few notes on at some point, and/or have tried to incorporate how. work, etc.

What I'm listening to as I'm doing some filing and sorting, and also putting stuff into Zotero to better keep track of citations. Why? reasons tk

## Maker vs Manager 

Got reading [Maker vs. Manager: How Your Schedule Can Make or Break You](https://fs.blog/2017/12/maker-vs-manager/) [^fsb] from the Farnam Street blog, and it jogged a few ideas for me

[^fsb]: [[@fsblogMakerVsManager2017]]

I've read about the Maker vs Manager schedule before, and in a few different contexts. I've also read Deep Work by Cal Newport that this article mentions quite a bit. 

Have a bunch of notes in Instapaper that I'll clean up later, but it got me thinking about

- different types of work
- context boundaries
- different schedules for different types of work (maker vs manager)
- but also considering how it impacts different neurotypes / ADHD / etc 

For something I've read a bunch about before, it did get me reflecting a bunch on how I work, and some ideas to start making some improvements. 

# Fin 

Enough big-screen time for the night, time to lower the desk and get ready for bed.
