# 2021-02-18 - [[The Evening Ramble]]

# End of Work Thoughts
- today was a pretty busy day
- lots of back to back meetings - got a bit brain-zonked by the end of it
- Getting inspired by how Facts & Snacks / Learning Hub / Teaching efforts are going
- Played around with some Vue Unit testing at the end of day for a quick proof of concept on testing route guards beyond verifying that next has been called.
