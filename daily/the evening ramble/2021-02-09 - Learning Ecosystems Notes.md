## Highlights

> Learning Ecosystems Don’t Just Happen Organically, Here are 3 Steps to Build one


> -   **decentralized** — an ecosystem is a web of relationships, it has no one single authority;
-   **peer-driven** — an ecosystem depends on input (and output) from all elements, living and nonliving; and
-   **agile** — a natural ecosystem can resiliently evolve and find balance through change.

> Creating harmony and balance in workplace learning takes an organized, concerted effort. In order to achieve the learning ecosystem vision, you must build, implement, and maintain it. [h.](https://hyp.is/20nhfmtFEeuftqfYXPihHw/360learning.com/blog/learning-ecosystems/)

> ### CLO and other L&D team members facilitate the learning ecosystem


### Employees learn and pass feedback up the chain

> The major responsibility of employees in a learning ecosystem is to learn. But [they can’t just aimlessly surf through learning content](https://360learning.com/blog/self-directed-learning/); they must pursue measurable learning goals that align with personal and business OKRs. And they must pay attention to gaps in their learning content and communicate them to managers and L&D — this kind of communication helps L&D perpetually [assess and fulfill training needs](https://360learning.com/blog/training-needs-analysis/). [h.](https://hyp.is/20nhfmtFEeuftqfYXPihHw/360learning.com/blog/learning-ecosystems/)


### Managers coach their employee-learners

> When it comes to learning, [think of managers as coaches](https://hbr.org/2019/11/the-leader-as-coach): They should be on the sidelines, ready to [motivate and support their employees](http://blog.idonethis.com/intrinsic-motivation/) throughout learning. Specifically, they should:

supporting via 

> -   help employees set learning goals,
> -   suggest learning paths,
> -   highlight learning opportunities that compliment day-to-day work
> -   monitor and encourage progress, and
> -   step in to resolve obstacles as needed.

I think that the "highlight learning opportunities that compliment day-to-day work" one is really important. #tk 

Even though I didn't manage the delivery of the team for the people reporting to me, I would work with the technical director, etc of the project to try and identify / create learning opportunities.

Trying to find a balance of what they are interested in learning, and what skills we are needing to develop internally. 

### C-Level Executives Advocate for the learning ecosystem

> For any learning culture to have legs, including a learning ecosystem, it must have executive-level support. Executives have the ability to build learning into the foundation of a company’s culture ([and, not for nothing, budget](https://360learning.com/blog/defend-your-2021-training-budget/)), so buy-in is essential.

> But beyond buy-in, executives have an opportunity to [take learning to the next level by becoming learning advocates](https://learning.linkedin.com/content/dam/me/learning/resources/pdfs/LinkedIn-Learning-2020-Workplace-Learning-Report.pdf). Specifically, they have an opportunity to bolster engagement by promoting L&D, creating executive course content themselves, and encouraging top-down incentives for learning.

## 2. Choose a learning tool that facilitates peer-to-peer knowledge flow

> If your goal is a learning ecosystem, though, you need to [offer more than a catalog of self-serve courses](https://360learning.com/blog/collaborative-learning-lms-elearning/) to engage learners and avoid a learning infrastructure that’s too dependent on L&D. [h.](https://hyp.is/_1l0rGtGEeuoIZPwERwXGw/360learning.com/blog/learning-ecosystems/)

- we want to facilitate and enable learning, not be barriers to it.

> “Employees use social media and search in their spare time to satisfy their curiosity, right when they need it,” [says Elisabetta Galli](https://hbr.org/2019/02/making-learning-a-part-of-everyday-work), Global Head of Knowledge, Development, and Talent Management at Banco Santander. “It should be exactly the same at work ... This is our vision: to create a learning-in-the-flow-of-work ecosystem and become a learning organization, whose workforce is upskilled in real time.”

> How do you achieve learning in the flow of work? By giving your employees tools to create, share, and iterate learning content directly (and in turn, freeing L&D to focus on higher-level strategy, not just content creation). In other words, by tapping into [Collaborative Learning](http://360learning.com/collaborative-learning).

> When employees can create, share, and iterate learning content autonomously, you can cut out the go-between (L&D) and [avoid needless back-and-forth and bottlenecking](https://360learning.com/blog/360learning-for-enterprise/).

> Plus, when subject-matter experts are empowered to easily share their institutional knowledge in a new course, it’s easier to maintain a library of relevant, up-to-date learning content.

> With the bandwidth they win back, L&D departments can focus on facilitating this new knowledge flow. So instead of scrambling to keep pace, they help employees learn from one another directly and maintain a healthy, sustainable learning ecosystem.

This is where I've been interested in helping facilitate the guilds, lunch and learns, etc - to try and help keep things moving along smoothly.

Also getting a sense of where people are at, helps identify the skill gaps as well - and if aligned with longer term company vision, and help get the guilds aligned, but still allow for alot of aoutnomony in them.

## 3 Align and measure your learning ecosystem against business goals

> Natural ecosystems have only one imperative: biological survival. Learning ecosystems don’t fight biological survival, but they do need to maintain ROI and align with business goals in order to stay viable.

> Seventy-nine percent of CEOs believe [skill gaps could threaten the health of their organizations](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/news-room/press-releases/2019/ceos-upskilling-workforce.html).
