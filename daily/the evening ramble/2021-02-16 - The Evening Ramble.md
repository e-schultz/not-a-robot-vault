# 2021-02-16 - [[The Evening Ramble]]

Wrapping up the workday, imported some stuff from Readwise that I've taken notes on lately - still unsure of how I want to handle the flow of stuff from Readwise into these notes. TBD.

Would also be useful if I could get Zotero citations / references pointing to the Readwise notes.

# Readwise + Zotero - how?

For example, earlier today when I was reading [[Combating Unconscious Gender Bias in the Workplace]] - took some notes using [hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is/) -> which is synced up to Readwise. 

Added it to my [[Zotero]] library to use as a reference, and have the reference key - [[@dewarCombatingUnconsciousGender2019]] 

Having a way to cleanly link the two would be handy.

I don't have as much control over what meta-data to pull in from Readwise, but maybe tweaking the Zotero export could clean that up a bit better.

Or --> don't worry about it until I start to from 'fleeting inbox note', to something more substantial. 

# Making your writing work for you - my Vue Talk

Started a quick draft of when I've leveraged 'making my notes work for me' for when I was preparing for a VueJS talk, still very much draft/rouh note

# Some Note Cleanup

-  [[Self Care]]
	-  had a few notes linking to this page. When working in the Obsidian editor - backlinks / etc show up fine, but have noticed when in publish mode - unless you have some content in the file, the page is blank - and can't discover things that are linking back to it.
-  [[Rangle.io]]
	-  When writing about work/etc, been mentioning Rangle - so created a little stub page to start being able to surface things to expand on later
-  [[PartnerStack]] 
	-  same as above,

# Raw Signal Training

Had the first session of the [[Raw Signal - Blueprint Training]] today, just introductions and going over a bit of what the program is about, and what too expect over the next couple of weeks.

I've heard good things about it, and it's nice to see work invest in [[leadership training]] / [[management training]].

Had some of this playing in the background while listening to the Raw Signal training, I like it's vibe - a bit chill, but not too demanding of your attention.

Don't recognize most of the artists in the track list, might dig into that a bit more later.
