# 2021-02-16 - [[The Evening Ramble]]

Wrapping up the workday, imported some stuff from Readwise that I've taken notes on lately - still unsure of how I want to handle the flow of stuff from Readwise into these notes. TBD.

Would also be useful if I could get Zotero citations / references pointing to the Readwise notes.

# Readwise + Zotero - how?

For example, earlier today when I was reading [[Combating Unconscious Gender Bias in the Workplace]] - took some notes using [hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is/) -> which is synced up to Readwise. 

Added it to my [[Zotero]] library to use as a reference, and have the reference key - [[@dewarCombatingUnconsciousGender2019]] 

Having a way to cleanly link the two would be handy.

I don't have as much control over what meta-data to pull in from Readwise, but maybe tweaking the Zotero export could clean that up a bit better.

Or --> don't worry about it until I start to from 'fleeting inbox note', to something more substantial.
