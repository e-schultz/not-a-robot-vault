# Engineering and Writing

I used to help quite a bit with the [Rangle.io blog](https://rangle.io/blog/), both with my [own posts](https://rangle.io/blog/author/evan/), but supporting others as well.

I think there is alot of value in writing - either it be for a blog, internal documentation, etc - and found this thread by [[Stephanie Morillo]] to have a bunch of great advice and resources.

> If your company blog is struggling to find engineers to write for it, there are a few reasons why:
> 1. You're not proactively looking for writers
> 2. Your strict deadlines don't account for an engineer's existing priorities
> 3. You're not giving ppl enough onramps for writing - via [@radiomorillo](https://twitter.com/radiomorillo/status/1359880970510495745) [^1rad]

# My Last Teaching Engagement


*note* - very rough draft of something I want to actually write about later.

Life before COVID19 seems so strange, but there was a client that I had created a JavaScript / React training course for. 

It's all open source, and still available online. 

> note: some examples may not run because the hosts they relied on are not up right now.

- [slide deck](https://rio-react-training.now.sh/decks/home/#0)

... Ok, this ended up getting kind of long - and something I actually want to work on later, so shoved it off to it's own page. -> [[202101 My Last Teaching Engagement - storydump|My Last Teaching Engagement - storydump]]

# Whats a [[Story Dump]]?

I guess it's kind of like an info-dump, just the stream of conscious get it out and down. 

The formatting is off, it's out of order, and basically needs a bunch of refactoring and clean up. 

Maybe I'll get back to it, maybe I won't.
