# Engineering and Writing

I used to help quite a bit with the [Rangle.io blog](https://rangle.io/blog/), both with my [own posts](https://rangle.io/blog/author/evan/), but supporting others as well.

I think there is alot of value in writing - either it be for a blog, internal documentation, etc - and found this thread by [[Stephanie Morillo]] to have a bunch of great advice and resources.

> If your company blog is struggling to find engineers to write for it, there are a few reasons why:
> 1. You're not proactively looking for writers
> 2. Your strict deadlines don't account for an engineer's existing priorities
> 3. You're not giving ppl enough onramps for writing - via [@radiomorillo](https://twitter.com/radiomorillo/status/1359880970510495745) [^1rad]

This set has been one that's been on my playlist frequently - haven't dug into their other stuff yet, but I should at some point.

# [[Learning Culture vs Teaching Culture]]

This is something that has been on my mind for awhile, and keep circling back around to it in various ways.

I've seen lots of companies claim to have a learning culture, and maybe they once did - when they were smaller, people worked closer more often, more organic peer-to-peer teaching happened - and it happened organically. 

Then, as teams grow and scale - there is this desire to cross your fingers, and hope what started organically - keeps growing organically.

It rarely does. 

Some of the challenges I think, and found that some of these were mirrored in [[@chanOurRoadmapBecoming|Our Roadmap for Becoming a Strategic Chief Learning Officer]]

## Goal: Wanting to Learn How To Teach Better

It hasn't been that often in my career that I've really set a specific goal. I've never been a 5-year career map kind of person, I've never had an intentional career roadmap or plan. [^1nfm]

[^1nfm]: **note** I think this may be why it can feel new to try and do it for others. maybe?

But, in one of the rare few times I've decided on a specific goal - it's that [[I wanted to learn how to teach better]]. and in turn - help others learn how to teach.

### Was more of a realization than a goal

When I was working at Rangle.io, I wore many hats - but some of the things that I enjoyed the most, and found most rewarding was things related to

#### The Many Hats

- teaching
- mentoring
- workshops
- writing - writing for our blog, helping support it,
- helping others write
- public speaking / presenting
- helping with meetups and events 
- helping others with presentations
- facilitating guilds / knowledge sharing 
- also helping with the programs that supported these things
 
I also helped start cross-project code reviews, overseeing the process, providing coaching on how to do code reviews and have them be helpful. 

### Training for Clients

I was also on client projects, had direct reports, and wore various other hats while at Rangle.

Rangle also offered training as a service - and I helped create and run a number of training programs for JavaScript. AngularJS, Angular, React, etc. 

We'd have people hire us to teach their teams JavaScript - so we had a number of people create training material, learn how to run through it, etc.

I took a few workshops by [[Greg Wilson]] on "How to run a workshop workshop", and have always found them useful, and the book [Teaching Tech Together](https://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html) is still something I reference often.

### Teaching in General

I really enjoyed helping other people at Rangle work on blog posts, conference talks, CFPs, etc. 

There is a lot of skill that goes into technical writing, and making it approachable and accessible. 

I was supporting them in writing in many ways, but also teaching them how to teach. How to break down ideas, consider the experts blind spot, guide the reader along.

# My Last Teaching Engagement


*note* - very rough draft of something I want to actually write about later.

Life before COVID19 seems so strange, but there was a client that I had created a JavaScript / React training course for. 

It's all open source, and still available online. 

> note: some examples may not run because the hosts they relied on are not up right now.

- [slide deck](https://rio-react-training.now.sh/decks/home/#0)

... Ok, this ended up getting kind of long - and something I actually want to work on later, so shoved it off to it's own page. -> [[202101 My Last Teaching Engagement - storydump|My Last Teaching Engagement - storydump]]

# Whats a [[Story Dump]]?

I guess it's kind of like an info-dump, just the stream of conscious get it out and down. 

The formatting is off, it's out of order, and basically needs a bunch of refactoring and clean up. 

Maybe I'll get back to it, maybe I won't.
