# 2021-02-02 - [[The Evening Ramble]]

Another day wrapping up, I liked the revisit to [[2021-02-02 - The Morning Pages|the morning pages]] that I had this morning, and felt like it helped get me off to a better start of my day. 

Too often over the last few weeks I've been doing too much of the

- wake up
- hit snooze
- order in breakfast, or get Timmies for breakfast
- lay in bed, then move right to work mode a few minutes before the first meeting

Being able to wake up, do some chores, do some reading - and get my head moving before starting the work day was nice, and something I was good at keeping up with earlier on in the pandemic. 

When I was checking my calendar this morning - I had noticed I had a bit of a run of back-to-back-to-back meetings, and moved a few around to allow for some breathing room, breaks - and time for self-care.

It can be easy to fall into the trap of feeling like you need to have every hour of your calendar booked with a meeting or something - but having focus time, think time, etc are also very important. 

If I am jumping from meeting to meeting about different things - the context switching is hard, and then if I am having a one-on-one as well - I enter that meeting distracted, and it's not fair for the people who are reporting to me.

This was talked about by [[Emilie Wapnick]] in her TEDx Talk - [Why some of us don't have one true calling](https://www.ted.com/talks/emilie_wapnick_why_some_of_us_don_t_have_one_true_calling)

How she explains [[multipotentialite]] is that there are three super powers:
