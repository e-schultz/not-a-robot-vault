# 4 Quick Questions

## 1. Have you had any prior management training? If so, what was it, and how did you like it?

Not much directly related to management. Mostly books - Radical Candour, Leadership & Self Deception.

Some at the recommendation of my manager, others I found on my own, really enjoyed the books.

Have done some communication courses, but nothing specifically towards management. 

The training has generally been pretty useful but would have appreciated more of it before becoming a manager for the first time. 

## 2. Do you manage people right now? If so, how many people report directly to you?

- Yes, currently have four people reporting to me.

## 3. What are you hoping to get out of this program, personally?

A better understanding of how to help with performance plans/growth maps / etc, and also more on the team alignment/motivation. 

I think I do ok on the individual level - but getting goals and alignment across the team, and the larger organization is an area I could improve on.

## 4. What do you hope the management team gets out of this, as a whole?
