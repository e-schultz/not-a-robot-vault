# Brick Wall

Felt like I had a strong start to the day. Then hit a wall + the right string of noises all at once has put me down for a few hours. Focused on the light hum of my heating unit fan and my cat laying next to me.

Calling it a nap isn't the right thing - as pretty sure I've been awake for the entire time. Very much a resting my eyes (+ other senses), kind of situation. Usually something on low volume in the background is nice - but not today.

Did manage to get most of the chores I had wanted to get done on the weekend dealt with during lunch / breaks between meetings. But it feels like someone has scooped out my insides and has left me hollow.

# Simple Morning Routines

Realizing I haven't had much to eat today - when I was out running errands I had meant to grab a few basics from shoppers while I was there.

DIdn't happen - got cat food instead of human food.

Hopefully tomorrow I'll feel up for a small grocery run = last week when most of my breakfast / lunch was made at home, and not ordering in or from timmies was nice.

Knowing that I have food in the house in the mornings does make it a bit easier to get the day rolling, instead of me waking up and rolling right back into bed.

Making some simple food while waiting for the coffee to boil, gets me up and moving around. 

But for now, waiting for some delivery to come, and probably go to bed early.

While I am not tired tired, I am sensory tired.
