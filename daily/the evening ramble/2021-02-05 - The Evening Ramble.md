# 2021-02-05 - [[The Evening Ramble]]

# End of the Work Week

When I was having a one on one with my manager today, I think I mentioned that this is one of the weeks that I've enjoyed the most since starting at [[PartnerStack]].

Like - I've been enjoying my time here, adjusting, etc - and I've had good weeks, but this one I've really enjoyed.

Been building out the Learning Hub, helping coordinate Lunch and Learns, getting back into supporting Teaching / Training efforts, etc - which is work that I really enjoy doing, and I think plays well to the sets of skills that I have.

Also - the start of the year was rough, for so many reasons - and starting to get a bit out of that brain-fog-funk, but - it's still a process - so really enjoying this week may also just be in contrast to January being a really tough month.

## I think I'm starting to Unmask a bit more also

I think this also has something to do with it in general - there is something about going remote that sort had put me into 'masking all the time' mode, and at times forcing too much structure onto myself, and there were days/weeks where it'd feel like I'm breaking my brain. 

- Sometimes the unmasking has been intentional, and measured
- Sometimes it's been accidental
- Sometimes it's because I'm just so fried, and it's unintentional - but I don't really have an option

This does seem to have an interesting side effect though of at times

- Feeling really at ease, comfortable, confident 
	- then shortly after wondering if I shared too much, was too much, or was over whelming
- Feeling like if I've enjoyed myself
	- That there must be something that I'm missing

When you have decades of when 'you just being you', got comments like you are too intense, too much, etc - when you have those moments where you do feel really at ease, and like you are being yourself, it can have a follow-up feeling of insecurity.

Being vulnerable can be scary at times. 

# Misc Bits

> "no, you don't - you just had your eyes opened" this is it...whiteness ALWAYS defaults to hero/victim. This is why empathy is bullshit

> Hanlon's razor has two main problems from my point of view: - It makes intention the important thing (really: just stop the impact, no matter what!) - It assumes to be able to make an educated guess about intentions, closely tied to the white culture belief that everyone wants to be a good person and would not willingly benefit from oppression and exploitation of others. Which is a belief, not a fact, and history teaches totally differently.

> "never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity" this is how white supremacy maintains its grip...whiteness being "stupid/ignorant" is not a flaw but a feature of the design. If you knew, as early as Black folx do, about life's reality and how you benefit, there would be some that would be ok with it, but most wouldn't. By the time y'all do see it, it is who you are and requires "efforting" to shif

# Assume Good Intentions

This, this is a phrase that I get wary of, and while I wrote this article awhile ago called [The Harm In Insincere Compliments](https://medium.com/@e_p82/the-harm-in-insincere-compliments-d5e8deed2ba3) [^1ep], I think this falls under assume good intentions as well.
[^1ep]: [[@e_p82]] [[The Harm in Insincere Compliments]]

The phrase can be a bit of a trigger phrase for me, because white people with good intentions, especially cis, heterosexual, neurotypical white people with good intentions cause so much harm, and have no idea why.

Some misc things that I'll get back to reading more later

## How Good Intent Undermines Diversity and Inclusion

![[2021-02-05 - The Evening Ramble#^ab8520]]

Skimming through the article by Analee - I've read this before, and think I have some notes on it. But, going to pull out a few of the sub-headings for now.

> But asking people to “assume good intent” will actually undermine your code of conduct and make marginalized people feel less welcome and less safe in your community. - [h.](https://hyp.is/-msuVmgGEeufdHMO-ozDYg/thebias.com/2017/09/26/how-good-intent-undermines-diversity-and-inclusion/)

> Telling people to “assume good intent” sends a message about whose feelings you plan to center when an issue arises in your community. [h.](https://hyp.is/HNFGEGgHEeuigC_199KNPQ/thebias.com/2017/09/26/how-good-intent-undermines-diversity-and-inclusion/)

> A positive rule is still a rule, and it still bans behavior that contradicts it. You need to think carefully about what behaviors your positive expectations are banning, and who those bans will affect. “Assume good intent” is a particularly pernicious positive expectation that will undermine your code of conduct. The implied inverse of this is that _not_ assuming good intent is against the rules. [h.](https://hyp.is/MzTXeGgHEeusnlsxOWCqjA/thebias.com/2017/09/26/how-good-intent-undermines-diversity-and-inclusion/)


### Codes of Conduct Address Systemic Inequities

> As a community leader, you don’t want to build spaces where people react calmly to getting their foot stepped on for the millionth time. You want to build spaces where people can trust that they are safe from being stepped on. [h.](https://hyp.is/bBnJkGgHEeunEscbuxQ0mg/thebias.com/2017/09/26/how-good-intent-undermines-diversity-and-inclusion/)


###  The False Equivalence of Treating Harassment as Interpersonal Conflict

>  Addressing incidents as if they’re simple conflicts between the parties involved sets up a false equivalence between dealing with discrimination and dealing with the momentary discomfort of being told you hurt someone. [h.](https://thebias.com/2017/09/26/how-good-intent-undermines-diversity-and-inclusion/)


###  Invalidating Victims’ Feelings

> Worrying about ‘assuming good intent’ when one party has harmed another is centering the feelings of the person who behaved badly, and expecting the person they hurt to center their feelings, too. [h.](https://hyp.is/HPOE_mgIEeuu6IsfBs8Wfg/thebias.com/2017/09/26/how-good-intent-undermines-diversity-and-inclusion/)


- This ties into understanding that harassment and conflict are different things, and that there is also a difference between hurt feelings and harm.
- When real harm is caused - asking me to be understanding of your hurt feelings, continues the cycle of harm. 
- Being put into a position of being expected to accept an insincere apology - or being labeled as the difficult one if you don't - #tk 

> Telling people to ‘assume good intent’ is telling them that no matter how badly they hurt, they still need to smile and be nice so the person who hurt them won’t feel blamed. [h.](https://hyp.is/u2YCQmgIEeuPa-dyka1SeQ/thebias.com/2017/09/26/how-good-intent-undermines-diversity-and-inclusion/)

This one hits home, and goes back a bit to what I talked about in [[The Harm in Insincere Compliments]] - so often I was told to play with the bully. 

### Policing Victims’ Reactions

> Including “assume good intent” in your code of conduct tells victims that they aren’t safe in your space, because if they do anything to make others feel bad about harming them, they will be held accountable for breaking the rules. [h.](https://hyp.is/AsEBPGgJEeu34Ee_OzEaFA/thebias.com/2017/09/26/how-good-intent-undermines-diversity-and-inclusion/)


### Questioning Victims’ Perceptions

> Marginalized people already know that we’re supposed to “assume good intent” in others. We are told every day that we’re “paranoid,” “overreacting,” or just plain “crazy” if we don’t feel good about being treated badly. This process is called ‘gaslighting,’ and it’s a way of making marginalized people distrust our own perceptions so we won’t object to being mistreated. [h.](https://hyp.is/vnxvOGgJEeuUQq_tVLb9BQ/thebias.com/2017/09/26/how-good-intent-undermines-diversity-and-inclusion/)

>  Members of other marginalized groups develop similar forms of pattern recognition to protect themselves from harm, often based on signs so small they can’t consciously describe them. [h.](https://hyp.is/4XN4fmgJEeujA9_uo9WxtQ/thebias.com/2017/09/26/how-good-intent-undermines-diversity-and-inclusion/)

- We are used to being invited into places that we are told and safe are inclusive
	- and then being harmed in those spaces
		- often by people claiming to be allies
	- when we voice our concerns - we get dismissed, told we are sensitive 
	- we get told that it didn't happen that way 
	- then consider those who have been impacted but domestic abuse, narcissistic abuse and manipulation
		-   and also how that intersects with marginalized communities
			- and how that intersects with neurodiverse 
	- the amount of harm I have been on the receiving end because of 'assume good intentions', is too much.

> When you tell people in your community to “assume good intent,” you’re reinforcing the notion that marginalized people shouldn’t trust their instincts. [h.](https://hyp.is/ltXGpGgKEeuuvCfKeQhBKA/thebias.com/2017/09/26/how-good-intent-undermines-diversity-and-inclusion/)

> Culture-setting documents like your code of conduct and corporate values should be designed around protecting marginalized people from harmful behavior. Leave out “assume good intent.” Instead, create a culture that recognizes and pushes back against the ways that marginalized people are dehumanized. Expect people to demonstrate their good intent by treating people with respect. [h.](https://thebias.com/2017/09/26/how-good-intent-undermines-diversity-and-inclusion/)



###  Who Are You Protecting?

> But society at large is already inclined to assume good intent in people with power and privilege–even when they’re not demonstrating it. If you want to build a culture of “assuming good intent,” start by assuming good intent in marginalized people. [h.](https://hyp.is/GGHRkGgLEeuu8DvPiAHCBQ/thebias.com/2017/09/26/how-good-intent-undermines-diversity-and-inclusion/)

## Microaggressions: Good Intent Is Not Good Enough

Ok, looks like I'm note-taking....  [[S-Microaggressions: Good Intent Is Not Good Enough]] by [[Rebekah Bastian]] [^1r]

[^1r]: [Rebekah Bastian](https://www.forbes.com/sites/rebekahbastian/)

### Highlights / Notes

> [Microaggressions](http://www.bbc.com/capital/story/20180406-the-tiny-ways-youre-offensive---and-you-dont-even-know-it) are brief queries, comments or actions in day-to-day life that target marginalized groups. They are often not _intended_ to be malicious, but over time they can lead to a toxic work environment and can preclude feelings of [belonging](https://www.forbes.com/sites/rebekahbastian/2019/04/10/the-business-case-for-belonging/).

> A recent [study from McKinsey & Company](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/gender-equality/women-in-the-workplace-2018) shared that almost two-thirds of women experience microaggressions in the workplace, commonly in the form of needing to provide more evidence of their competence than me

> Black women reported an especially high rate of enduring unprofessional language, and lesbian women are the most likely to hear demeaning remarks. While less data exists on men of color, there is strong anecdotal evidence that black men experience microaggressions in the workplace as well, often being painted as aggressive or intimidating. All of these encounters add up; employees who experience microaggressions are three times more likely to regularly think about leaving their jobs.

#### Avoid Biases

> Unintentional microaggressions are usually the manifestation of unconscious biases, which are learned, automatic stereotypes that have the ability to affect our behavior. Most people do not believe that they are racist, sexist, ageist, heterosexist, etc., but their words and actions can surface biases that reflect discriminatory belief systems [h.](https://hyp.is/aWxCuGgMEeuZbXP4paCU6w/www.forbes.com/sites/rebekahbastian/2019/06/10/microaggressions-good-intent-is-not-good-enough/)

> -   If someone holds a bias that a given population is not articulate, they might “compliment” a person for being well spoken. [h.](https://hyp.is/mtl7BGgMEeu_b3OoDCOM_Q/www.forbes.com/sites/rebekahbastian/2019/06/10/microaggressions-good-intent-is-not-good-enough/) - [[Abelism]]

> -   If someone holds a bias that a given population is aggressive, they might give a person feedback that they are “intimidating,” while the same behaviors are considered “assertive” in another person. - [h.](https://hyp.is/t8ZvEGgMEeuchFenbk4RSw/www.forbes.com/sites/rebekahbastian/2019/06/10/microaggressions-good-intent-is-not-good-enough/)


### Repair Damages

> Even well-intentioned people who have done the work to uncover biases and try to avoid manifesting them can still mess up. [Research has shown](https://labs.psych.ucsb.edu/major/brenda/docs/Dover,%20Major,%20Kaiser%202016.pdf) that discussions of biases in diversity training can cause majority groups to become defensive, [h.](https://hyp.is/354uQmgMEeuEBtvy6CceXA/www.forbes.com/sites/rebekahbastian/2019/06/10/microaggressions-good-intent-is-not-good-enough/)

Oh, that research is available as a PDF -> [[S-  Members of high-status groups are threatened by pro-diversity organizational messages]]

> While a perpetrator of microaggressions might have not intended to hurt someone, the recipient might still feel deeply hurt, which has been shown to [lead to elevated levels of depression](https://www.centerforhealthjournalism.org/2017/11/08/how-racism-and-microaggressions-lead-worse-health).

- [[S-How racism and microaggressions lead to worse health]] by [[Gina Torino]]

> Good intentions are important, but the impacts of people’s actions are the true measure of goodness. By channeling intentions into learning about biases and the ways that they manifest into microaggressions, work relationships can be strengthened and harm to marginalized groups can be reduced.

# [[Neurodiverse Twitter]]

## Not sure if this is imposter syndrome, or #neurodiverse thing, or both.

- [Tweet](https://twitter.com/i/status/1357857483658829824) by [@evan_just_evan](https://twitter.com/evan_just_evan) on [[2021-02-05]]: [[@evan_just_evan]]
- Not sure if this is imposter syndrome, or #neurodiverse thing, or both.
  - For the longest time, I was convinced that I wasn't smart - that I was just faking it really well, and somehow would get exposed for being a complete idiot.
  - Like, I'm pretty daft.
- In Grade 3,
  - I had a teacher try to put me into special ed - I had a bad stutter, couldn't read out loud, she liked to yell at me - not a great mix.
  - So I remember doing a test to see if I should goto special ed
- Apparently not,
  - Then shortly after - I was taking a test to see if I should be going into the gifted/enriched program.
  - Apparently, I bombed it the first time on purpose because I didn't want to change schools.
  - Then I did it again, did fine - but stayed at my school
- (that part is a bit fuzzy in my memory, but it's how my mom tells it)
  - My grades were usually a few things I did very well in, and then a bunch of stuff with low grades.
  - It was either like B+ or with no effort, or a D's / fails - when I was putting in so much effort.
- "You could do good if you only applied yourself"
  - *gestures to the few good grades as proof of me applying myself*
  - "You could do good if you only tried"
  - "You have so much potential"
- While being dismissive of the things that I was good at.
  - It made me not trust in the things that I was good at.
  - There were some subjects that just clicked with me, and I excelled at without much effort compared to other classes
- Then there were subjects that I liked, or wanted to like - and tried really hard at.
  - Sometimes I ended up doing well.
  - Often they would be my worse grades.
- So I kind of got it in my head, that being smart was
  - doing well at hard things
  - but have a hard time at doing well
  - If that makes sense.
  - Like, if something was easy for me - I didn't trust I was actually good at it, because it wasn't hard.
- And even as an adult now, I know that there are certain types of work that I can excel in, and certain ways that I work that can really leverage how I think.
  - But, I still find myself falling into the
  - "If I tried just a little harder at X, then I would be better at it" trap.
- I do enjoy hard things and new challenges - but sometimes not so great at identifying when the challenge is, is it challenging:
  - Because my brain just doesn't work that way
  - Because it's a hard problem - that is a good match for how I work.


# [[Everything Is Not A Requirement]] #tk 

> I think the closest I've ever got to losing my temper in a meeting, was slightly raising my voice, but very sternly saying - "Everything. Is. Not. A. Requirement." .... and then apologized immediately after.

Also known as the "Nate has Ideas" incident. 

But, That's None of my Business. 

There are so many in-jokes and memes from Team Squad, duck life. quack. 

I really didn't expect a project that would have me traveling to Cleveland upto 3 weeks out of the month, would have been one of my favorite projects.

It had it's challenges/issues, but some of it was great - and with that group of people was such a great mix. 

I remember when we started driving there in shared cars instead of flying, because the 4hour road trip or whatever hanging out with them was more fun than dealing with the airport. 

# Oh, I don't think it's been done

Going to have to go back to my notes for this. 

### Why I Like Otter.ai 

- [Tweet](https://twitter.com/i/status/1357863073923682309) by [@evan_just_evan](https://twitter.com/evan_just_evan) on [[2021-02-05]]:
- 🤔 I think I may have found another benefit of auto transcription software.
  - 🧠 It captures accidental information-dump in meetings and helps process what was a rather overwhelming output of information.
- Was having a one on one, and something that I'm working on kinda plays into a special interest - that is also connected to a few other things that I'm really excited about.
  - It woulda been impossible to keep up with to write down
- Some of this stuff has also been kinda stuck in my head recently, and I've tried writing it down - but it wouldn't come outright.
  - and this was just like, the right set of prompts clicked in my head, and *information vomit*
- and - I don't think I would have even remembered what I said.
  - At times when I do that, it's like some sort of autopilot kicks in, and words just flop out.
  - and then forget what I said moments later.
- Being able to go back and edit the transcript after - and the editing flow with otter is really nice (for me), helps me remember better.
  - I don't edit every transcript, and how much I do - depends on what I need it for.
- But going through to fix up spelling, add breaks (it doesn't add paragraphs well and it's a lot of wall of text) - but the mix of reading/fixing/listening / re-listening is really useful for me.
- I kind of appreciate that the transcript quality isn't always perfect, as part of my reason for using the tool is to help with sensory issues.
  - Something about the editing and hearing the sound bites replay as I edit and skip around just clicks in my brain.

## So, in those notes

Was talking about approaches to training and education, and talking about some ideas - and a comment was made along the lines of I haven't seen it done before. 

But,

### I think most places approach Learning Culture wrong

I've been at, seen enough times where a culture of learning was boasted, but wasn't able to scale - or be followed through on.

Then, what usually ends up happening is something along the lines of

- a learning allowance, maybe a conference budget (when those were a thing)
- maybe get recommended a few online courses 
- maybe work towards getting a certification 

And, it feels like it becomes more of this passive thing, that we "consume, if we have time - then carry on with whatever we were doing before, and forget what we just learned"

#### If they are trying to do a bit better

Maybe they will have a career ladder, a road-map - and try to get you training on things to work towards a goal, and basically try to re-create a a kind of traditional academic model into the work place.


##### Also a very neurotypical approach

#tk - but I just have issues with the education system, when companies want to try and take [[learning and development]] seriously, they are trying to model a system that I hate, find ablest and discriminatory.
