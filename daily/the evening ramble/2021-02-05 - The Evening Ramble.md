# 2021-02-05 - [[The Evening Ramble]]

# End of the Work Week

When I was having a one on one with my manager today, I think I mentioned that this is one of the weeks that I've enjoyed the most since starting at [[PartnerStack]].

Like - I've been enjoying my time here, adjusting, etc - and I've had good weeks, but this one I've really enjoyed.

Been building out the Learning Hub, helping coordinate Lunch and Learns, getting back into supporting Teaching / Training efforts, etc - which is work that I really enjoy doing, and I think plays well to the sets of skills that I have.

Also - the start of the year was rough, for so many reasons - and starting to get a bit out of that brain-fog-funk, but - it's still a process - so really enjoying this week may also just be in contrast to January being a really tough month.

## I think I'm starting to Unmask a bit more also

> I think this also has something to do with it in general - there is something about going remote that sort had put me into 'masking all the time' mode, and at times forcing too much structure onto myself, and there were days/weeks where it'd feel like I'm breaking my brain.

# Misc Bits

> "no, you don't - you just had your eyes opened" this is it...whiteness ALWAYS defaults to hero/victim. This is why empathy is bullshit

> Hanlon's razor has two main problems from my point of view: - It makes intention the important thing (really: just stop the impact, no matter what!) - It assumes to be able to make an educated guess about intentions, closely tied to the white culture belief that everyone wants to be a good person and would not willingly benefit from oppression and exploitation of others. Which is a belief, not a fact, and history teaches totally differently.

> "never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity" this is how white supremacy maintains its grip...whiteness being "stupid/ignorant" is not a flaw but a feature of the design. If you knew, as early as Black folx do, about life's reality and how you benefit, there would be some that would be ok with it, but most wouldn't. By the time y'all do see it, it is who you are and requires "efforting" to shif

# reclaim your humanity from the grip of white supremacy

> White folx developing an antiracist practice is the ONLY to reclaim your humanity from the grip of white supremacy Being antiracist is the ONLY path for white folx to save themselves FROM themselves - [[Kim Crayton]] - [@KimCrayton1](https://twitter.com/KimCrayton1/status/1357822859905753091)

# Assume Good Intentions

This, this is a phrase that I get wary of, and while I wrote this article awhile ago called [The Harm In Insincere Compliments](https://medium.com/@e_p82/the-harm-in-insincere-compliments-d5e8deed2ba3) [^1ep], I think this falls under assume good intentions as well.
[^1ep]: [[@e_p82]] [[The Harm in Insincere Compliments]]

The phrase can be a bit of a trigger phrase for me, because white people with good intentions, especially cis, heterosexual, neurotypical white people with good intentions cause so much harm, and have no idea why.

Some misc things that I'll get back to reading more later

Ah yes, did a tweet search for times I've [tweeted about intent](https://twitter.com/search?q=intent%20(from%3Ae_p82)&src=typed_query)

## [[Tech Twitter]]

- I've had a bit of an issue with "the rubric" for hiring, although at times had a hard time explaining why. This thread gives a good summary. I get the intent behind it, but feel it can do more harm than good. [@e_p82](https://twitter.com/e_p82/status/1283708458559250434)

> One of the most annoying things I kept getting told during my time at Amazon was "Keep calm and assume positive intent". My boss even had a sticker on his laptop. It was one of the most toxic environments I ever worked in. [@jina]( https://twitter.com/jina/status/1280950434459340802?s=20)

Also known as the "Nate has Ideas" incident. 

But, That's None of my Business. 

There are so many in-jokes and memes from Team Squad, duck life. quack. 

I really didn't expect a project that would have me traveling to Cleveland upto 3 weeks out of the month, would have been one of my favorite projects.

It had it's challenges/issues, but some of it was great - and with that group of people was such a great mix. 

I remember when we started driving there in shared cars instead of flying, because the 4hour road trip or whatever hanging out with them was more fun than dealing with the airport. 

# Oh, I don't think it's been done

Going to have to go back to my notes for this.

## So, in those notes

Was talking about approaches to training and education, and talking about some ideas - and a comment was made along the lines of I haven't seen it done before. 

But,

### I think most places approach Learning Culture wrong
