# Everyone is Zoom Height

It's approaching a year of working remote, I know most people only from the shoulders up.

Everyone is zoom height.

# Designing for users on the autistic spectrum

Saw this on twitter today, and one of the things that stood out to me - was considering [[a11y|accessibility]] needs for [[neurodivergent|neurodiverse]] people.

I've seen the occasional thing mentioning design considerations for [[dyslexia]], but rare that I've seen things for ADHD or autism, or at least explicitly mentioned.

# Some Note Maintenance

Going to make some tag-pages / index pages for words/terms I use alot - eventually will make use of backlinks and unlinked mentions to start gathering things into a more organized form. Eventually.

Moved into -> [[index pages]], for now.

# I tend to write in bullets a lot

I think this is one of the things that first attracted me to Roam research, and I may still end up using it for some stuff and ideation, and notes that are a little less polished.

The point of  "simple sentences and bullets" [^a11yasd] stood out to me, as I tend to write in bullet point form alot, and then indent a lot.

[^a11yasd]: [[202102120101 - Designing for users on the autistic spectrum#^121b98]]

- Roam does support this style of writing really well, and easy to have multi-line bullets if you wanted.
	- and then you could nest
		- and nest
			- and nest
				- and then block embed something from above or below
					- and be able to edit it
				- and could quickly outline
			- and rearrange things

But, it was't for the sake of having a 'bullet point list', each node was a thought - it acted as an outliner. 

I'm finding that with Obsidian - my thought blocks tend to be a bit "bigger", which has it's own pro's and con's I suppose, and I'm also more aware that I'm working in a file system - which has it's own trade offs. 

## Features I'd like to see in Obsidian 

### Edit mode on active block, preview on the rest

One feature that I hope makes it over to Obsidian, is having the 'inactive block' display in preview mode. That way if I have something embedded above this and I'm writing - I could still see the content of the embed, but right now while I'm in edit mode - I cant.

### ((as short cut for a block ref search))

Obsidian added block refs recently, but I find making use of them to be a bit clunky - it would be nice if you could do something like ((start typing)) - and once you find what you want, convert it to the more markdown-friendly format that they have adopted. 

### Copy selection as reference 

Quality of Life improvement - if I'm on another page, and copy - have the option to 'copy as reference' - and when I past it into the new place, it converts it to the backlink format that it supports. 

### I do kind of miss the web app

Having a desktop app with a file system has it's benefits, and there is the Obsidian sync service, although I currently back things up myself to github, but I did like how I could bounce between devices and not really need to worry - just open up a browser, login and go. 

Trade offs.
