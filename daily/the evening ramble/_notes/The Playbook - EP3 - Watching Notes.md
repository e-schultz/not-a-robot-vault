The opening questions are kind of interesting - he doesn't want to be very open, doesn't want to speak about his past, etc. This differs quite a bit from the other episodes - where being open and vulnerable is a big part of their story.

### 1. Understand your audience
- He wasn't picking just top players, but also looked into the psychological profile of the players. Ones that matched the values of the team. 
- They never lost a game on their home terf - and he felt that a big part of that success, was due to the profile of the team. 

> I think the reason why was because of the profile of the team

### 2. If you are prepared for the worst, you are prepared
- Getting Manchester United would have been one of the worst options for them, but he created at atmosphere of "I want Manchester United" - to get people prepared for the worst.  
	- It made them excited for the challenge, instead of fearing the challenge 

### 3. The underdog Attack
- Find the right moment to be aggressive 
	- Know when to push the team
		- it can make the win feel more exciting, at times - if the win feels like a slog, the win may not feel rewarding 


### 4. Some rules are meant to be broken

- Mourinho was banned for two matches, but felt that for this game it was important for him to be there

> They need, what I used to call that skin to skin connection. Where do you want to have the feeling where they listen to you, where you can share emotions. - [[José Mourinho|Mourinho]]

- the team won, although that wasn't the main point for him - it was bending the rules to be there for the team. But, he was bending the rules for them, not just himself. 

### 5. The train doesn't stop twice

- With the rate that managers get sacked, "it's important to leave on your own terms"

>  So I think is very very important to leave a club by your own option. - [[José Mourinho|Mourinho]]

as the episode progresses - the arrogance at the start starts to fade a bit, while he may be short with the press / etc - you can tell that he cares very much about the team's he coaches. 

When he got the offer for Madrid - it was one of his dreams, so he took that opportunity - as it may not come again. 

### 6. Don't Coach the Player, coach the Team 

>  If you are not able to coach the big players, you are not able to coach anyone  - [[José Mourinho|Mourinho]]

Even the big players, skilled players - they need to be coached on how to work as a team. 


> the players that have to understand the game. Because during the game I cannot make decisions for them - [[José Mourinho|Mourinho]]

> They cannot express everything they have everything is about the team I always used to say that I don't coach football players. I coach football teams - [[José Mourinho|Mourinho]]
