Thinking back to [[The Playbook - EP3 - Watching Notes|The Playbook - EP3]], and one of the rules that has been bouncing around my head [[20201-02-02|today]] has been

and how that relates to me and my experience being a manager.

When I was a worked at Rangle, due to the nature of the company, the structure of projects - it was pretty common for me to have people reporting to me that were not involved on projects that I was responsible for the delivery of.

It was common for people to move between projects depending on the staffing needs, the size of the project, new clients coming in, etc.

This meant that a team could have a number of people on them - each of them with a different manager.

It also meant that when I had six people reporting to me - it was six people on six different projects.

This approach has it's pro's and con's - which maybe I'll explore a bit later, #tk but one of the impacts that it had of how I approached management - was kind of "focusing on the player".

## Focusing On The Player

Team Dynamics were still very important - and I would work closely with the 

- Technical Director 
- Scrum Master 
- Client Partner, 

and other members of the team to help ensure that people felt supported, had growth opportunities, etc - but, it was from a very outside perspective. 

One of the differences that I have while working at PartnerStack - is that I am a manager of a team, a group of people that are reporting to me, and also responsible for the delivery and output of the team. 

It's been a shift in adapting to this change - some of it comes naturally, some if is taking some effort.
