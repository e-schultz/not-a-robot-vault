[[2021-02-02|Today]], joined a session hosted by Linked In on [Driving Change How to Create a More Equitable and Inclusive Workspace](https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/webinars/21/01/virtual-event-driving-change-create-an-equitable-inclusive-workplace) - and found it pretty interesting, even though it seemed to be more targeted at recruiters/talent teams - but even as an Engineering Manager I found it really informative, and also helped a few ideas click into place, and/or confirm a few hunches that I've had about building inclusive work spaces.

[[Diversity Equity Inclusion|Diversity, Equity and Inclusion]] has always been important, but with the events of 2020, the pandemic causing many organizations shift to remote work - it's now becoming more important than even, and it's crucial to get right.


[[Jacqueline Jones]] - Head of Strategic Partnerships at LinkedIn was the host, with 

- [[Melissa Thompson]] - SVP of Talent Acquisition. at Nielsen,
- [[Danny Guillory]] - head of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 

A few points really stood out to me, that I want to think on / expand on a bit more over time.

- Shifting mindset from [[DEI Workshop - Interview Out vs Interview In|Interview Out vs Interview In]]
- Thinking  [[Career Jungle Gym vs Career Ladder]]
- Knowing when to stop and educate, before taking action

Used otter.ai to record the transcript, cleaned it up and have it here as a PDF -

Few more things I want to expand on later, but - enough chewing on that in my head for now.
