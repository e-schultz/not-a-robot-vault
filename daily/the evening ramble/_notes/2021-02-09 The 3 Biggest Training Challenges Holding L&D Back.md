# The 3 Biggest Training Challenges Holding L&D Back (and How to Overcome Them)

## Highlights 

###  Training challenge #1: Business teams utilize their own makeshift learning over L&D programs

> But wanting to learn more doesn’t mean wanting more L&D, at least in the traditional sense. Employees often prefer informal channels over L&D programs when they need information: According to _Harvard Business Review,_ 55% of [employees will turn to a coworker before checking a learning platform](https://hbr.org/2018/11/how-to-help-your-employees-learn-from-each-other) (or Googling the answer).

- **note** I think being able to recognize/enable the peer to peer teaching / learning better - that can help alot.
	- I also think. that at times, people don't recognize that they have learned something because they haven't had the opportunity to reflect on it, or try and explain it to somebody else.

> “Why go through the hoops of (boring and outdated) corporate training when I could just ask the person next to me or send a message on Slack?”  
  > 
> But when knowledge is transferred from one employee to another in private, that information is siloed. According to the [Panopto Workplace Knowledge and Productivity Report](https://www.panopto.com/resource/valuing-workplace-knowledge/), 42% of the knowledge that powers a business lives (and leaves) with individual employees.

- **note** - trying to turn that informal slack session into a reusable course / tutorial takes time and effort. It is possible though, but maybe that work can be distrusted. Like the python profiling L&L - I could probably make a mini tutorial out of that, and having the transcript / recording handy helps.
	- If we are able to collect the information, break it down into smaller and easier to maintain pieces,

> As a result, 72% of [employees struggle to find the info they need](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/focus/human-capital-trends/2014/hc-trends-2014-overwhelmed-employee.html) on company learning platforms. Then, they write off the learning platform as unhelpful, continue asking one another instead, and the cycle continues.

- **note** - having governance in place, and ways to update and flag outdated information, and also have it appear contextually where they might expect to find it (think - things like backlinks and relationships in notion)
	- there can be a tendency to want to gate-keep knowledge sharing too often, if 'updating the main copy' takes so much effort, that is where the informal sharing starts to happen.
		- how do we facilitate a balance of that?

### How can you make learning platforms more appealing?

> The challenge is to make the learning platform _the_ place to find the most valuable and up-to-date knowledge. The solution isn’t to break employees’ habit of learning from one another; the solution is to leverage that habit.
