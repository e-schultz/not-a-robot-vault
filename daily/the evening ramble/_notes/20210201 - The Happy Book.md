# The Happy Book

The bright yellow, dot-grid note-book that really did kick off alot of my approaches to self-care, building habits, checking in, reflection -  and two of my older journals are now acting as a wrist-wrest for my keyboard, so having them around as that reminder is still useful in it's own way.

So much of my life has become digital-centric since COVID19 - work, social life, family communication - that once the workday is done, that spending more time at the 
- same desk 
- same laptop 
- same screen 

Quickly looses it's appeal - at times I'll switch laptops, maybe surf Twitter on my phone instead of my laptop, or poke a bit at my what seems to be neglected iPad - despite really enjoying drawing with Procreate. 

I want/need to bring some physical back into my life - motion is important to me, either it be walking, dancing, yoga, stretching - but also writing, drawing, making music - things that engage physical touch and motion.
