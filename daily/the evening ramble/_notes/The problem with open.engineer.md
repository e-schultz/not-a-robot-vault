Friend of mine sent me a link to [this tweet](https://twitter.com/juliaferraioli/status/1355296260664610816) about [[open.engineer]] and asked for my take on it. 

Yes, they are scraping public information - although it is a bit weird to find myself having a [fairly fleshed out profile](https://open.engineer/e-schultz) - and honestly, I think sites like this can cause harm.

This site is also similar to [[xs code|xs:code]] which has [similar issues/concerns](https://twitter.com/coderbyheart/status/1353068512508403713)

The concern with sites like open.engineer and xs:code - is in the biases that it reinforces, and how others may use or interpret this data. 

There can be alot of pressure on newer developers to try and have the perfect profile site, an active github repo that can showcase their work, etc 

While having things like an active public online presence can provide some extra data points when trying to evaluate candidates,  it can also be used as a tool for gatekeeping within the tech industry.

There are lots of "ghost developers" - who are excellent developers and engineers - but due to the nature of their work, are on private repo's, self-hosted repo's, using sites other than GitHub, etc. 

They may not have the time, and/or interest in maintaining a public profile - they are busy doing work, at work. When scraping sites like GitHub - you are getting an incomplete picture of that person. 

Other people on twitter, such as @isislovecruft [points out that they were misgendered twice in the same paragraph](https://twitter.com/isislovecruft/status/1355575520516206597)

#### Heavy Focus on Open Source Contributions

Tech still has a long way to go to being an inclusive place for marginalized groups - and while some open source communities are better than others, it can be hard to become active in some projects - especially ones that "rank high" on sites like open.engineer and xs:code 

There is also an aspect of privacy and safety - not everyone is comfortable having their real name associated with github and public activity, and if the reliance on sites like this increases - it's cutting out a number of people from tech.

#### Just because it doesn't harm you ...

There are a number of people that are excited by sites like this, and feel that the site does not bring any harm to them - which is great for them, but I think an important question to still consider is 

> what is the potential harm for others?
> what can we do to reduce that harm? #tk
