# Bedroom Office

I think I wrote a bit about this awhile ago [^1ll], but a few weeks ago when I was having [[light sensitivity]] issues - I had moved my home office into my bedroom to see if that would help.

Anyways, the TL;DR - having my desk in my living room was causing problems for me with light, and after awhile - I decided to move my desk into my bedroom. 

## Was meant to be temporary

Initially, it was meant to be temporary - but, in some ways I've come to enjoy it.

- Forgot I like having my bed next to a wall
- I feel like I actually have more floor space
- Feeling a bit more enclosed helps me focus a bit actually
- My living room feels more open

## Should it be?

I was going to buy some curtains that I could hang up to help with blocking out more light, and the idea was - move my desk back out to my living room after.

I should still probably get the curtains - as even on weekends / outside of work this was becoming an issue.

But, if I keep things in my room long term, downsides?

## Why Not?

Main reason -> Really easy to spend entire day in the bedroom, even after work.

I tend to relax in my bed-room quite a bit, which means I can end up going days without really using my living room at all.

Being able to have a separation between work space, and sleep space is good. 

Although, does the separation need to be physical? or could it be a matter of routine.

- At the end of each day, I do lower the desk from the standing height to being almost as low as it can go, that is very much my "end of day" signifier 
- Make use of the extra space
	- Without everything as crammed into my living room - easier to make space for working out / etc
- Replace the couch

Usually unless I'm gaming - I tend to be lying down when I watch most stuff, I just don't like sitting (yay standing desk)

But, get something that better fits how I use that space. 

Also, could consider how to make my living room more comfortable, and have that be a bit more of my go-to relax space.
