# First Therapy at Shift

I remember the first time going to therapy at Shift - and it felt like I went on a nearly two-hour info dump talking a mile a minute, everything came out all at once - and I was impressed by their ability to both keep up with me, but pick out some important patterns - and offered some actionable advice. 

He noticed how much things relating to movement/motion were for me for [[+ Self Care MoC]]

- Walking to/from work
- Walking breaks
- Dancing
- Exercise
- Writing in my journal 
- etc 

Being ADHD - it's no surprise that movement is important to me, and find that I often need to be moving to work through my thoughts, or I'll end up trapped in my head. 

A bit of how I've been feeling recently - is giving me some vibes back to my burnout at Rangle, and trying to hit the breaks a bit sooner - and start focusing with a bit more intent on things.
