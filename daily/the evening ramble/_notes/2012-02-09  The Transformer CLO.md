> “accelerate wisdom more effectively by providing a series of contexts where people can play and learn at the same time.” [h.](https://hyp.is/WCqMKmtLEeuqW1t1F7GFkw/hbr.org/2020/01/the-transformer-clo)

> One notable success is GANDALF Scholars, in which employees can apply to receive grants of $1,000 toward training on any work-related topic, as long as they agree to teach what they learn to at least 10 other people.

- **note** I kind of like that idea, not sure I'd do it the exact same way 

> When you engage employees in teaching, as DBS is doing, you expand and deepen learning. Rahul Varma, the senior managing director for talent at Accenture, calls this a “leaders teaching leaders” philosophy. “You learn the most,” he said, “when you actually have to teach somebody what you learn.”

> UBS, DBS, Accenture, and other companies that have embraced a growth mindset subscribe to two beliefs: 
> - that everyone’s abilities can and must be developed if the organization is to thrive in a fast-moving environment, 
> -and **that innate talent is just the starting point.**

- **note** - really like the idea of recognizing that the talent is the starting point, the ability to learn, grow and teach others 

> To accommodate the different preferences employees have for how they consume and absorb information, a growing number of companies now make training available through a variety of media—text, audio, video, and more. - [hbr](https://hbr.org/2020/01/the-transformer-clo)

>  They’re offering games and simulations and encouraging the company’s own subject-matter experts to produce YouTube-type instructional videos.

- **note** facilitating a culture of learning, and helping grow it 

> Villeneuve and her team focused on developing a core of fewer but better resources

- **note** - when adding content, evaluate the quality, and also the why it's being shared/etc to help give context. the inbox that collects everything - people stop trusting.

### Rethink face-to-face learning.

> As engaging and effective as digital learning experiences can be, face-to-face learning is still important—although it may take new forms. Accenture employs some very sophisticated digital learning platforms and tools and has a vast library of online content, but Varma’s experience is that digital learning goes only so far. “What we’ve found,” he said, “is that there is no substitute for getting people together in cohorts that are cross-cultural and cross-functional.”

### Go beyond instruction.

> Transformer CLOs are personalizing, digitizing, and atomizing learning.

- **note** - I've been thinking about the idea of atomic notes and lessons - smaller pieces, where on their own they are useful, but can be built up into a larger program.
	- but keeping each piece useful on it's own, they become easier to update
	- can also think about ideas like the minimal manual, etc


> Transformer CLOs believe that instruction alone is not sufficient for meaningful learning. Accenture’s Varma anchors his approach in what he calls the three I’s: instruction, introspection, and immersion.

### Transforming Learning Departments

> Instead of simply taking requests and providing training for specific skills, they are teaming up with the leaders of other business units to dramatically improve capabilities, performance, and even culture throughout the organization.

> To support this new approach, CLOs are hiring learning strategists, experience designers, curators, and software developers. They’re helping employees become peer teachers, guides, and coaches. And they’re applying agile and lean start-up principles to their efforts to devise learning programs.

### Act as curators and cocreators.

- **note** - helping offload some of the effort in creation can really help

> Increasingly, transformer CLOs are identifying useful external content—everything from university courses to blog posts to YouTube videos—and combining it with internal content developed in consultation with the company’s subject-matter experts

- **note** the curation aspect is important, or there becomes too much noise and it's hard to find things. Been adding a lot up front with the learning hub, and might need to cut down some noise - but needed some material there to start showing the potential.
	- this is also why I've been trying to keep track of the channel / etc it's shared in - linking back to that, as that also has extra context.
	- When we have recorrings and transcripts - that material can be repurposed into other formats
		- as we caputre things along the way - it can start to become a reinforcing loop

> To provide high-quality, relevant learning at scale, Varma and his team created a framework and tools to help in-house subject-matter experts develop their own learning boards (think Pinterest boards for different topics in the business). These then become easily accessible, on-demand learning modules.

- **note** - something about this reminds me of

### Foster learning from peers.

> Accenture’s learning boards show the appeal and usefulness of learning from colleagues as well as professional instructors.

> Accenture’s learning boards show the appeal and usefulness of learning from colleagues as well as professional instructors. It’s a practice that DBS Bank has adopted, too, going beyond its GANDALF Scholars program to launch Back to School, a series of employee-led training sessions. In multiple classrooms around the world, 45-minute sessions take place throughout the day for as long as a week. Classes cover technical subjects (such as DevOps and machine learning), business topics (for example, how the credit-card industry makes money), and “softer” subjects (such as personal branding and business storytelling). These courses are taught not by formal instructors but by internal subject-matter experts—managing directors, middle managers, and even new associates—whose range in seniority helps promote a culture in which expertise is valued over rank.

- **note** [[note to self]] - loook into [[Accenture's Learning Boards]] more.

> Peer learning can arise anywhere in an organization, of course, not just within the formal learning department.

- **note** - need to be able to recognize the value in that,

> Transformer CLOs pay attention to this. When new learning activities spring up, they investigate what’s happening and why. If the new effort has merit, they figure out how to support and amplify it.

- **note** I really like the idea of amplifying what's going on - how redux got adopted at rangle, tooling across the company, but it was boosting what other people were doing, and creating the space for it to happen.
