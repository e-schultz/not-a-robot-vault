# 2021-02-17 - [[The Evening Ramble]]

# [[The Playlist]] Still ...

[[Alpenglühen 56 with Adhémar & F-on#^665468]]

Liked it so much I [tweeted about it](https://twitter.com/evan_just_evan/status/1362188911997558785) and went on a bit of a ramble 

> This set has been making my brain very happy all day. Stil not done listening to it - 5 hour set, currently four hours into it. It's mellow but chuggy - good working music for me.
> It can fade into the background and not be that distracting. But when you pay attention to it - it's interesting, has alot of subtle shifts to the patterns. I could just as easily dance to this, or chill out and relax.

.... anyways, this set pleases me.

# Evening Routine

When I wrapped up work, made a point to relax in the living room instead of just crashing out on my bed. 

Killed a bit of time on twitter, cleaned a bit - but having a bit of a separation between being at my desk for work, vs relaxing at night.

This was in response to a thread on ADHD, and how we internalize things that people say in different ways.

Was in [this thread](https://twitter.com/danidonovan/status/1361816703760539650) by [[@danidonovan]]

> “Why do you have such low self-esteem?” Idk, could have something to do with a lifetime of being criticized?
> ![Table with headers: “What You Say” and “What I Internalize”
“I expected more from you” = “I’m a disappointment.”
“You’re smarter than this” = I’m being stupid.
“I hate to see you wasting your potential” = “I’m a failure and it’s all my fault.”
“You need a filter” + “I’m annoying.”
“You figure it out, I don’t care how” = “I shouldn’t ask for help.”
“It’s not that hard” = I shouldn’t be struggling.
“You need to grow up” = “I’m a bad adult.”
“What’s WRONG with you?” = “I’m Belem and unlovable.”
“You need to pull your weight more” = “I’m a burden and people resent me.”
“Just try harder” = “I’m lazy.”
“It feels like you’re doing this on purpose” = “I will never be enough.”
“You never change” = “I never change.”](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EuYlEbFWgAcsX_P?format=jpg&name=large)

Someone had commented that the "you need to pull your weight more" can be objectively true. 

I don't necessarily disagree - but when given as feedback, is pretty useless.

# Downside of the never ending questions

![[20210217 - under performing - but why#^fbf46c]]

At some point you need to stop asking questions, and start putting a plan into place. 

At times the series of questions can become a bit of a branch, and other areas may need to be addressed - so need to figure out what to prioritize and when, of which -> I'm still working at.
