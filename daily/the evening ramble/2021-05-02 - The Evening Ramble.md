## Time is Weird

Although that is always going to be the case during lock-down, although I've noticed this past week it's felt like my brain has been locked into ADHD-waiting-mode for awhile, but not sure what for.

Ahwell, went for a walk this afternoon - and on the way back bumped into PDS who I used to work with at Rangle, and got talking about how things are going - and he had heard that I had left PartnerStack recently.

Talked a bit about what I was thinking on, including the TL;DR of [[Building Not A Robot MoC]] - PDS worked with me on the [[RoboIns engagement]], and especially in the earlier days of that project, it was

- one of the most enjoyable times at work we had
	- also is a bit of a mini-model/example of the 'helping grow learning cultures'
		- The way that we worked there also, was really adapting to the needs of the learners, and meeting them with where they were at. 
		- This got me thinking about the Old vs Node modes of training talked about  in [[ðŸ“– The Upskilling Imparative]]
		- ![[TUI - Table 1.1 Old vs New Trraining Modes]]
			- There was a lot of anticipatory training going on - by working closely with the teams, noticing common trends, or what upcoming requirements might need people to learn - adapting on the spot.
			- quick-break out sessions
			- pair programming
			- the quick L&L's around usually RxJS topics that were bite sized
			- [[Leveraging code reviews as L&D opportunities]]
