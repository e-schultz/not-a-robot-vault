# First Entry 

So, this is the start of [[Not A Robot]], I think this is worthy of a vault of it's own.

Basically, Not A Robot is a collection of stories, notes, thoughts about me - and my experiences growing up [[queer]], [[neurodiverse]], [[ðŸŒ± working in tech]], and about other things that I care about.

Kind of
- part journal
- part zettelkasten
- part blog
- part collection of notes

It could be stories about growing up, like the time my sister threw a dart in my eye, to struggling with undiagnosed ADHD through most of school,  how I learned programming, lessons learned from on the job, and how my experiences being neurodiverse and queer - shape how I view building teams, inclusive enviornments - but also being aware of my own blindspots.

Some of these are also the [[stories that I repeat to myself]] - important moments that I've learned from, and as I grow and understand more things - being able to look at them through a new lens. 

I tend to leave a [[pretty large digital footprint]], and may link to tweet-threads and insta-grams, both as a way of connecting my thoughts - but also bring some organization to the [[information spray]] I have sent across the internet.
