Took a few notes on this, but one of the stats on the impact of [[gender bias]] that stood out to me was

>   When hiring managers believed a woman had children because â€œParent-Teacher Association coordinator appeared on her resume, she was [79%](https://leanin.org/endnotes-50-ways#endnote132) less likely to be hired. If she was hired, she would be offered an average of $11,000 less in salary. [h.justEvan](https://hyp.is/puDgMnCUEeudfEclLhpD_g/www.lever.co/blog/unconscious-gender-bias/)

- *note* I recall when learning how to do interviews once, the person who was helping me made a comment along the lines of: 
	- "__one of the things I look for is an engagement ring, as it's a sign that they are getting married soon - and want the job just to get mat leave__"  - biased manager 
	- I remember being rather shocked by that statement, and I didn't speak up about it at that time directly - although did push back against it a bit, but it's one of those memories that really stood out as 'wow, that is kind of messed up'
