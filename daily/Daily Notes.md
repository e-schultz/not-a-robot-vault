# Daily Notes

This is basically my public-stream of thought. As I've been working in [[The Morning Pages]], or [[The Evening Ramble]] - been wondering how I want to make use of these, and eventually turn them more into larger notes, etc.

So, I think for now - anything that is found under the Daily folder - is basically journal entries, or fragments of journals. 

It's the writing inbox - that over time, I'll go back and review - and see what themes I want to expand on.
