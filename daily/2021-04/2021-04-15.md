### Standard Uniform

- [Tweet](https://twitter.com/i/status/1382654447332036614) by [@evan_just_evan](https://twitter.com/evan_just_evan) on [[2021-04-15]]:
- That leather vest, and those pants are pretty much part of my daily uniform.
  - I've worn then from Regional Burns, techno parties, work, even dressed them up enough for a holiday party. [pic.twitter.com/3YsFSVfx83](https://twitter.com/evan_just_evan/status/1382654447332036614/photo/1)
- The pants - have parts that can be waxed to make them water resistant.
  - Stretchy parts that breath and don't restrict my movement.
  - Also have zippers on the sides that I can open / close to help with airflow and staying cool / warm.
- I can wear them on pretty warm summer days and be comfortable.
  - Toss on a thin base layer in the winter - and stay warm.
  - The leather vest was cheap - 2nd hand store in Berlin and only a few euros, but it's rare that I don't wear it.
- It Mayer's ontop of almost anything and looks good.
  - Also, sticky dollar store flare sticks well if I want some extra flare.
  - Or layer it with a scarf for a different look.
  - Or over a sweater dress [pic.twitter.com/mlCmG0YFvV](https://twitter.com/evan_just_evan/status/1382654457415090178/photo/1)
- It has a weight to it that I find comforting.
  - Standing near a bonfire on a cool night - it captures the heat and radiates for awhile after.
  - I can put my hands into the pockets and push / brace myself against it which feels nice.
- Between the pants and pockets in the vest - can carry my phone, charger, wallet, keys, kindle, earphones case and not need a bag.
- There's zippers on some inner pockets.
  - so um, if I'm running around in altered states üçÑ
  - put keys / wallet into those, zip them up and paranoia of losing my keys / wallet goes poof.
- I've lost weight since I got the pants, and they are getting a little worse for wear - so might get a new pair soon.
  - But, the same brand / style.
  - When I find something that feels that good / like a second skin on me - rather get the same thing twice.
- I really need to get new shoes soon.
  - I'm very much - "find something that I like, and wear it until I can no more"
  - These shoes have seen multiple summers, regional burns, private burns, taken me on 70k hikes, pride, raves, protests, etc - alot of memories attached to these [pic.twitter.com/f2XYZcCiGT](https://twitter.com/evan_just_evan/status/1382659315513839621/photo/1)
- I remember my first time wearing them out dancing, and they cut a chunk out of the back of my foot before they got broken in.
  - SPFDJ / Francois X - loud fast techno in a dark church basement.
  - Memories. [pic.twitter.com/E9jo4ljqyn](https://twitter.com/evan_just_evan/status/1382659320811257857/photo/1)

Playing around with the.rip - which spits can spit out a markdown formatted list of things that a user has liked recently.

- [@evan_just_evan](https://twitter.com/evan_just_evan) [@roryreckons](https://twitter.com/roryreckons) It's likely more that they had the audacity to protest than it was that their protests "were getting too effective."
- [@roryreckons](https://twitter.com/roryreckons) White people only think it's fascism because now it's affecting them. PoC in colonized countries have never had the right to protest‚Äîpeacefully or not.
- Stages of development are the reason that parents get obsessed with their children not acting 'normally'. They are arbitrary and not actually accurate. People seem to develop non-uniformly always. It's just bad science used to stigmatize neurodivergent people.
- I've not seen many people discuss how developmental psychology was actually a huge part of Autism becoming a 'problem'. Granville Stanley Hall is left out of discussions a lot. He basically pushed stages of development theory. Guess what he was? A eugenics scholar.
- [@evan_just_evan](https://twitter.com/evan_just_evan) I'm so glad it's getting there for you. The most unpleasant experience
- Is Indian Standard Time definitely 4.5 hours ahead of the U.K.? I need to calculate a time difference and don‚Äôt want to be wrong?!
- 'Don't treat mild ADHD' is something I had to read this week. 'Don't let kids know.'
  - I was apparently mild. I definitely needed to know why everything was impossible.
  - Nothing like repeated crushing failure to motivate you.
- No one tends to be more ableist than these people.
- I have an aversion to the word motivation as well. Because that is internally driven for me.
- Motivational speaker is generally the most tired genre of person.
  - They take good philosophy do capitalism to it.
  - Inspiration human... I conquered my self image issues with grifting - An overpaid person.
- Moving demand for sex work into unsafe spaces reduces the ability of sex workers to manager their risk of HIV and poor sexual health ‚Äî undermining efforts to end new #HIV cases.
  - Today we‚Äôve written a joint letter to MPs to voice our opposition to proposals for the Nordic Model. [pic.twitter.com/n2S9vlYlRA](https://twitter.com/THTorguk/status/1382619818239606784/photo/1)
- Seems probably coincidental that governments around the world are banning peaceful protest just as fascism is rising and inequality is at 1930's levels.
- [@kamilumin](https://twitter.com/kamilumin) Ya know what‚Äôs cool?
  - First guy I ‚Äúdated‚Äù I was 14 and he was 25. He said, what I now recognize as several red flags, like ‚Äúour little secret‚Äù and the less subtle ‚Äúdon‚Äôt tell your parents.‚Äù
  - I was literally in the situation that OP posted about and I STILL don‚Äôt agree with them
- I normally aim for humour/pith here but I'm just going to be sincere for sec.
  - Idk, like 500 ppl have followed me since I started banging on about adhd here.
  - That's lovely, see #adhdtwitter had been the most valuable resource to me since my dx
  - üßµ
- [@mister_smiley](https://twitter.com/mister_smiley) Apparently the only reason "gay mentors" are a thing is because older gays want to prey on young inexperienced gays
- It is not remotely a coincidence that this discourse repeats while TERF groups in the UK are claiming LGBTQ groups are trying to lower the age of consent
- I'd like to have just one month on here in which people don't call gay men disgusting predators for engaging in activities outside of their own personal comfort zone
- "Women don't belong in gay bars" discourse is over, "women stop applying cishet dynamics to gay men" discourse is in
- [@DanIsAYeti](https://twitter.com/DanIsAYeti) vaush constantly debates people about things he knows practically nothing about
- Transitioning in adulthood is fun, because you've essentially floated passively through most of your actual teens and 20s without any real sense of self, and then you end up essentially trying to speedrun them
- [@AnnaBebana](https://twitter.com/AnnaBebana) [@squishdivergent](https://twitter.com/squishdivergent) Right? I hate when legit survival techniques are demonized. Like, no, people mask for very logical reasons.
  - Whether those survival techniques are good or bad depends entirely on the context, and often they are both.
- i apologize for how much i complain about my eye issue, and also the amount this is affecting my processing is overwhelming.
  - at the very best, i just choose to ignore how much it is impacting my moment to moment.
  - everything in my brain feels like a bowl of jelly
- [@KimCrayton1](https://twitter.com/KimCrayton1) I think it‚Äôs part of the Male Fragility line
- Can someone please tell me what the fuck is ‚Äúunisex nail polish‚Äù? [twitter.com/complexstyle/s‚Ä¶](https://twitter.com/complexstyle/status/1382531855531008002)
- [@ComplexStyle](https://twitter.com/ComplexStyle) All nail polish is unisex!

- We have slipped into hyperspace kids. Buckle up ü§§
- looking forward to do more interactive art
- [@evan_just_evan](https://twitter.com/evan_just_evan) Same applies to principles based practices. Version control, build systems, and CI for principles. Git, rollup, and circle as practices. Principles last longer than practices
- "gay men are inherently predatory pedophiles and if you disagree you're one of them" [pic.twitter.com/vloRIpol1M](https://twitter.com/kamilumin/status/1382497603628244992/photo/1)
- Hi my name is Amy and I just set a work boundary. Everyone clap plz for the overly nice and giving girl who burns herself out by supporting everyone else all the time!!!
- üëÅüëÑüëÅ [pic.twitter.com/HZ9TNbfBW3](https://twitter.com/theferocity/status/1382490786915307521/video/1)
- Explaining to the creator of a technology that they're wrong about how it works is a bold move.
- If your interview process includes whiteboarding and problems that your candidates will never actually use on the job, your interview process isn't inclusive. Many people don't have time to spend weeks prepping..

  - crashing at 4pm üò©
- tried to juggle too much at once today and forgot my lunchtime meds :[
- Lack of inclusion is a risk, and increasingly a crisis, management issue [twitter.com/broadwayworld/‚Ä¶](https://twitter.com/broadwayworld/status/1382422908853698564)
- It‚Äôs perfectly natural to feel defensive during code review, even when the feedback is constructive and reasonable!
  - It‚Äôs proof you put a lot of care into that code.
  - But remember that it‚Äôs a great opportunity to learn.
  - (This does not apply if your reviewer is being a jerk)
- [@evan_just_evan](https://twitter.com/evan_just_evan) (Totenkitten must have been before my time.)

- "for a cis het white guy, you're pretty ok in my books"
  - Is something I've said like twice in my life.
  - To them, directly - and they were not offended by being called cis-het.
  - If they had been, they would no longer be ok I'm my books.
- These are all things I heard said by administrators in my previous position: ‚ÄúDo more with less. Wear multiple hats. Do the work of three people. Go the extra mile.‚Äù How about: Do less with less. Wear one hat. Do the work of one person. Go the number of miles you're paid to go. [twitter.com/biblioracle/st‚Ä¶](https://twitter.com/biblioracle/status/1382346615856504837)
- Looking back to where I was first diagnosed as #ADHD , something has me thinking it was really #Autism
  - Or quite likely both.
  - #ADHDAutism
- Thank you Animorphs for validating my desire to take a different ‚Äúshape‚Äù.
- [@lara_hogan](https://twitter.com/lara_hogan) It works as long as your company is not an agency. The minute you are, the mandate starts slipping because clients are not off the clock on these days.
  - Now you have people doing invisible work on days that they're "officially off" on.
- I've recently heard about companies mandating company-wide time off days, where EVERYBODY at the company takes the same day off (hoping to help with burnout/pandemic breathing room).
  - If you work at one of those companies, how has that gone for you? Did it help your energy?
- my mind refuses to engage with *anything* today and fortunately my schedule is quiet, so I'm going to take that as my win for the day

- I'm catching up on today's news &amp; see the headlines about Daunte Wright. I can't engage today. I spent hrs on the beach with my Black sons today ‚Äî we flew a friggin' kite! I want that beautiful memory preserved in my sleep tonight. I don't have enough to give this. And that's ok.
- In return they threatened to stop using heroku [pic.twitter.com/tOMStTPbKH](https://twitter.com/sarahmei/status/1381788061948764160/photo/1)
- Just ordered a burrito for delivery for dinner. When it showed up it looked tiny, I was wondering what happened. It turned out I only ordered a tortilla with chicken in it.
- Not sure what the answer is here to this,
  - but I'm pretty sure it should involve more guns. [twitter.com/therecount/sta‚Ä¶](https://twitter.com/therecount/status/1381725539346612227)
- Should developers know math?
- I really wish there was a way to turn off comments when cross posting to DEV.
  - It‚Äôs just not something that adds to the experience these days :/
- [@evan_just_evan](https://twitter.com/evan_just_evan) but it‚Äôs also so hard bc ADHD, i get bored very easily and i love to switch things up so finding a niche is haaarrrrd
- [@evan_just_evan](https://twitter.com/evan_just_evan) i‚Äôd LOVE to do that and i‚Äôm trying really hard to haha. i mean, my top special interest is content creation of any kind, and my second SPIN is neurodivergency. so i‚Äôm trying to make content around that. i‚Äôll get there eventually haha

  - I'm speechless.
- The internet is such an odd place.
  - I wrote that tooling post in like 20 minutes üòÇ
  - There are posts I spend days researching and editing and they aren't this popular.

  - Team of 1-3
  - $1-10m/year
  - &lt;40 hour weeks for everyone
  - A company doesn't have to be massive to be great
- I've had really, really bad luck at dating and relationships
  - I am getting better at spotting patterns of emotioal abuse and manipulation faster

- Just was notified that I got chosen for a job üòç
  - It still has to be approved by some  committee (it‚Äôs with public administration), but usually it‚Äôs a done deal at this point.
- People are conflating person who writes good tweets with person who actually influences the industry.
  - I‚Äôm maybe the former. Have in no way reached the second status.
  - That‚Äôs where the checkmarks are rightly going.
  - But we‚Äôre certainly not done yet!
- me, an hour ago: my zoom face is exhausted
- Impromptu campfire hangs with my chosen family are just what my soul needed on a nice day.
- FAQ: How do you get yourself ready to talk on a video or give a speech?
  - I often create a mindmap to prepare my thoughts. Watch the map unfold. Notice how it helps me navigate the talk and notice how I stray from it. The structure helps me to riff.

### Readwise Review

#### Smart Notes - Practice Learning
> If we practice learning not as a pure accumulation of knowledge, but as an attempt to build up a latticework of theories and mental models to which information can stick, we enter a virtuous circle where learning facilitates learning.

##### Initial Note
I have been building a bit of a [[virtuous circle]] around
-- tools for thought
- training and education
- mentoring
- and how to enable a neurodiverse workforce in the remote covid age
