"[[202102211918 Learning to Get comfortable with being uncomfortable|Get comfortable with being uncomfortable]]" is a common phrase that I'm starting to hear in more DEI training and initiatives.

This is something that I agree with. 

Often this growth requires us to recognize when we have been biased in the past, how we have benefited from privilege, and that's not something many people are comfortable with.

Especially if we have been trying to "do good things", and realize that maybe we have actually caused harm - that "oh shit I fucked up" feels bad, and we want to protect our feelings more than acknowledge the harm that we have caused.
