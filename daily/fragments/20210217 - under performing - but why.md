As a manager - there's other ways to address that, while being supportive and giving actionable advice. As a manager - that thinks alot about feedback, and the intersection of neurodiversity. "you need to pull your weight more" is low quality, unhelpful feedback. ^1929cf

It's much easier to blame the person instead of looking at the environment, and considering why / what is getting in the way of performing well. It's shitty feedback for anyone - neurodiverse or not. The RSD spiral of ADHD makes the negative impact worse.

For anyone it's unhelpful feedback - ADHD or not. Even if both sides of the statement are true, which they can be. - why? What are the factors that could be impacting thier performance (pulling thier weight), and why? Then have a feedback discussion around those. ^8fdaa8

 At times the under performance is a result of 
- not getting clear feedback 
-  not knowing expectations 
- same shared understanding of what success looks like 
-  unclear requirements 
- blocked and not asking for help 
-  but why? ^fbf46c

If you go past looking at the end result - there's so much more potential for useful feedback, and feedback that may help the entire team. As you start to understand the why - can get to actionable things to address it.
