##### Tweaking Readwise -- Obsidian Workflow

Initially, I was making a new note for every time a new highlight popped up, and this was starting to create a bunch of noise.

Sometimes - I'll grab highlights just to keep track of the document structure when I do an import later on, etc.

So, trying a new template in how I'm collecting notes for [[202102271101 RW-R - reading notes - schifferMailchimpEmployeesHave2021|Mailchimp employees have complained about inequality for years â€” is anyone listening]]

### Template Rough idea

- the tag setup is so I can group things around that, 
- the meta data in the comment is 'useful to me' stuff - that doesn't get rendered when published
	- but if I do use links / tags there - they will connect to other notes in that way
- A main section to capture the highlights
	- sub-headings for each highlight, and a bit of a summary of it in the heading, and then the actual highlight
	- then a section for notes
		- any initial notes I captured at the time of the highlight
		- then any notes I want to expand on over time

Over time, as this gets fleshed out - then I might break things out into smaller notes, connect them with other ideas, etc. 

### Still figuring out the Readwise Workflow

I still haven't figured out the 'when do I want to discard a note from Readwise yet', even if I have a bunch of information captured elsewhere on it.

Something I've started to do - copy the UID into the Readwise note/comment, and that way if Readwise surfaces it up again - I know I have it somewhere in my notes, and can look for that UID - and continue working in that note.
