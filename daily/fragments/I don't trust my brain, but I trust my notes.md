# I don't trust my brain, but I trust my notes.

## Notes
For the longest time before I was diagnosed as [[ADHD]] - I always felt like my problem was that I just needed to remember better. Like it was a matter of willpower, and I was just choosing to not remember. 

Things like test dates, and exam dates, and friends birthdays - you should just remember them if you care, right?

It felt like it was some sort of personal failure that I just couldn't remember better.

What I've been learning to do - is helping me build systems to help with recall.
