# [[Self Care]] Anchors

For example, I might look at patterns like

- How often am I ordering in?
- How messy are certain rooms in my house?
- Am I having a hard time, or easy time getting out of bed
- Am I avoiding friends?
- Am I avoiding family?
- Am I avoiding work?
- What does my relationship with my body feel like?
- What has my mood been like recently?
- What does my relationship with my mood feel like?
- What does my relationship with my health feel like?
- What does my relationship with my mental health feel like?
- Am I becoming addicted to busy?

This isn't an exhaustive list, 

If my place is a mess, and I'm ordering in a lot - maybe it is just a case of it's been a busy week, and getting back on top of things isn't a problem - and there isn't anything to worry about.

But, if it's been going on for a few weeks, my Uber Eats Bills is turning into receipts of shame, my body is feeling gross - and finding myself starting to retreat from my social circles - maybe it's time to check in and figure out what is going on.

It's a mix of being aware of what's going on - but also how I feel about that relationship with it. 

Sometimes, feeling good isn't always what it seems.
