# Sometimes a good mood can be a warning sign

For example - I may be feeling in a "good mood" in many measures at times, but 

- is there a bit of a manic energy 
- triggered energy going along with it? 
- am I feeling at ease with it?  
- Is the good mood coming at the cost of ignoring other things? 

Something I've noticed in the past - especially if I am starting to enter a bit of a triggered state - is I can start to get kind of excessively positive energy, become hyper social, network and reach out to people more often than I usually do.

This can be a bit of a trauma response for me - warning signs are going off that something isn't "quite right" - and I'm trying to gather as much information, connect the dots between things and figure out what's going on.

The good mood is being propelled by this very intense energy, and being in that state - often other aspects of my self-care routine might start falling apart. 

The good mood, is also part me trying to convince myself that everything is fine - but also trying to project to others that everything is fine.

And, there was a long time in my life when I didn't trust being happy, and it's been a process [[learning to trust happy]] again.
