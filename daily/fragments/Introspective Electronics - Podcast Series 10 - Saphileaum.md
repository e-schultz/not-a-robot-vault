# Introspective Electronics - Podcast Series 10 - Saphileaum

## Description
We are very proud to present another chapter of our Podcast Series helmed by our good friend and multi-media artist Andro Gogibedashvili aka Saphileaum. Originating from Tbilisi, Andro's musical output is consistently gaining recognition within the blossoming Georgian electronic music scene as well as internationally. Under his belt are numerous albums and EP's for respected outlets including @[silent-season](https://soundcloud.com/silent-season), @[annulled\_music](https://soundcloud.com/annulled_music), @[norite](https://soundcloud.com/norite) or @[oslated](https://soundcloud.com/oslated) 🌱🌝🌱

We invite you to sail the mystical rivers of world-music influenced ambient, tribal techno and new age electronics with us in this hour-long fairytale of a mix Saphileaum crafted for us ahead of the release of his upcoming long-player on Good Morning Tapes. A colourful journey oscillating between the ancient and yet to come, exploring the universe of plants and animals and stars, and the inner dreamscapes we all dream day and night ✨🌻✨ ^50a621
