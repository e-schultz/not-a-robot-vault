##### [[2021-03-17]]

Work was ok today, did start to fade a bit near the end. Still fit in a meditation break, and also a quick grocery run over lunch - so I now have some food-stuffs here for breakfast in the morning.

It'll be nice to not be ordering in MCD's or Timmies for a few days - and thankfully the grocery store didn't burn me out either.

So, it's been another [[good ðŸ§  day]], yay.

Some of the things I've started to do again this week,

- Short walks before work in the morning
- Meditation a few times a week during the day
- After-work walks 
- Writing more
- Making time to reset
- Spending a little less time on social media 
- Some groceries - less eating out for a bit
- Have time booked off


# Learning Maturity Matters Reading Notes

Got reading some stuff around [[learning and development]] / etc at work. 

Going to finish reading this later, but I liked the [[Learning Maturity Rubric]], and how they also break down organizational commitment/etc.
