# 2021-02-09 - [[The Evening Ramble]]

# [[Neurodiverse Tech]]

When I got rambling about [[2021-02-09#^4a950d|Lack of ND representation in DEI Materials]],  [[SageFranch]] from [[Crescendo]] replied 

> This is a really great idea! I know a lot of people who would read it (myself included) and get a ton of value from it. I'm here to support if you need help with editing and distribution - [@SageFranch](https://twitter.com/SageFranch/status/1358956462681260036)

and this is something that I'd be excited to work more on in the near future. 

At work, I started a [[neurodiverse squad]] slack channel, inspired a bit by [[Neurodiverse Twitter]], it's not really an employee resource group / ERG or anything, but a more informal place for people to come together and talk. 

But, this does give me the opportunity / reason to start collecting up my lots of scattered notes, and getting them into a more organized form. I've written alot about being ND in tech over the past year - largely from a personal experience/learning perspective - but also have a big collection of resources to pull on as well.

# Habit Tracking / Mood Logging

Building and sticking to habits can be kind of tricky at times, and have been using the app called [[Daylio]] to do regular mood check-ins for the last while, and it's been interesting to see how my mood fluctuates in relation to what activities I'm doing and what else is going on.

Able to set my on moods, sub-moods within, activities, etc. 

## [[Writing Goals]]

Decided to setup some writing goals within the application, and something that I liked is that it's not always about 'dont break the chain' and needing to do things every day.

I put in a goal for doing Morning Pages 3x a week, same with The Evening Ramble, and also a goal for doing a journal review once a week.

Now, if this actually keeps me doing those things - or just an annoying reminder that I ignore, time shall tell.


## Connecting the Dots

One of the things I like about this though, is especially with how much note taking / Journaling / etc that I keep here, in other forms, on twitter, etc - I can start to build up quite a bit of context of 'what was going on with X day for me', and get information beyond what is just logged in the application.

But, a simple [search on twitter for tweets I sent between 02-09 and -02-10](https://twitter.com/search?q=(from%3Aevan_just_evan)%20until%3A2021-02-10%20since%3A2021-02-09&src=typed_query&f=live) (time zones seem to include a few things I didn't expect, but meh) can get most of the tweets I've sent today. 

Combined with things like getting into a Readwise Review flow, what I'm reading on Instapaper, even things I've posted to Instagram, Facebook, Tiktok, and even my work notes. 

But, I think this is where a lot of the power of 'Linking Your Thinking' and 'Tools for Networked Thought' comes from.

Having this massive footprint of notes and information that we scatter around, but often in this broadcast once and never re-visit kind of way, is that this makes it easier to find what I've written about before, connect it to other ideas, and start building on-top of it.

# Break Time

Spent most of the afternoon heads down preparing a demo for the Learning Hub I've been building out at work and really excited about, but - I need to not be looking at my laptop right now....

## Evening Reading

So, starting to work through a few things I've been meaning to read lately, ended up taking a bunch of notes on [Only 5% of Managers Think Manager Training Works. Here’s What Needs to Change.](https://uptickapp.com/blog/only-5-of-managers-think-manager-training-works-heres-what-needs-to-change) - once readwise syncs I'll copy them over.

Although, this did lead me to the article
