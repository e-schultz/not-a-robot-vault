- [4 Steps to Reading a Textbook Quickly and Effectively](https://www.studyright.net/blog/4-steps-to-reading-a-textbook-quickly-and-effectively/)

Was actually about to start reading The Upskilling Imperative, and figured since I've been working on trying to improve how I approach note-taking/etc, figured a refresher on some tips for reading / notes would be usefuil.

- Read Backwards
	- Read questions / summary at the end first
	- Look at headings / subheadings in the chapter
	- Read intro then chapter
		-  > From that point you can then work through the chapter from front to back. By taking this out-of-order strategy, you are focusing not on the chronological order, but rather connecting the ideas found in the chapter together. _**This is infinitely more important than reading things in the order they were written.**_
-  Read for key details
-  Read for big ideas

### Deciding what to highlight 

-   Is it unique?
-   Is it helpful?
-   Is it interesting?
