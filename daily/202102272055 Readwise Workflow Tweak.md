For some reason it didn't occur to me that the "Page Title" in the configuration of the markdown export, would be the file name. 

###### - 

Something I was wondering about when doing exports, was if I could clearly separate my imported notes based on file name alone. ^350399

For things that I have a Zotero citation key for - I can also edit the pages meta-data to include that in the author string or something, so when I do an export and bring them into here.

- can have a file name convention to make it clear that it's an import 
- include a cite key - and then hard link it if I want

Tried this out when importing [[articles - Developer Microskills - Reducing the Pain of Context-Switching]].

Might tweak this a bit more later, and see if I could use templater somehow.
