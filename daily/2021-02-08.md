# Mid-day Crescendo 

I didn't do much writing on the weekend, at least in the notes here since the last  [[2021-02-05 - The Evening Ramble| evening ramble Ramble on Friday]], but meh.

I do have have some tweet-threads, etc I'd like to pull in later.

But, at work we are using the [[Crescendo]] app to surface interesting articles, and the one that came up last week - that I'm just geting around to is.

## Study: microaggressions in the workplace

### Higlights / Quotes

> “A senior partner asked to ‘touch my hair’ in order to confirm it was ‘all mine.’”
> “An older male colleague interrupted me in a meeting and said, ‘now young lady…’ and then told me how I was incorrect in his opinion.”
> “My hearing disability was described in a written evaluation by the board of trustees as ‘making communication difficult for my co-workers.’”  [h.](https://hyp.is/3OnMPGozEeuTm-PnZqa7Wg/www.surveymonkey.com/curiosity/microaggressions-research/www.surveymonkey.com/curiosity/microaggressions-research)

- Micoaggressions can surface in many ways, and have an impact both on the person, but also in how they are perceived by others

> Microaggressions—subtle, indirect, and sometimes unintentional acts of prejudice - [h.](https://hyp.is/u-l5tGo0EeugoT9KtlrDSQ/www.surveymonkey.com/curiosity/microaggressions-research/www.surveymonkey.com/curiosity/microaggressions-research)

- the fact that they are unintentional, does not reduce the harm that they can cause

#### The very real cost of microaggressions in the workplace

> Microaggressions are more widespread than you may think. More than a quarter of Americans (26%) have definitely experienced a microaggression at work, and another 22% are unsure. Thirty-six percent have witnessed one (with another 24% unsure).

> Seven in ten workers would be upset by one of these disrespectful interactions, and among those who were, half said the action would make them consider leaving their job.

> Experts [estimate](https://www.benefitnews.com/news/avoidable-turnover-costing-employers-big?brief=00000152-14a7-d1cc-a5fa-7cffccf00000) that losing a skilled employee costs a company roughly 33% of their annual salary—a high price to pay for some thoughtless words.

- While it's important to understand the impact it has on people, unfourtnatley the only way we can get companies to pay attention to issues like this at time, is understanding the impact on the bottom line of the business. 


#### What are the most common micoroaggressions?

> - Being addressed unprofessionally
> - Being told you are "well spoken"
> - Being spoken over

#### How microaggressions hurt underrepresented groups

> Microaggressions can be incredibly damaging in professional atmospheres. At work, minorities [already feel a lesser sense of belonging](https://www.surveymonkey.com/curiosity/how-surveymonkey-built-and-tested-a-survey-that-truly-measures-inclusion/) than their majority peers, and are acutely aware of the conscious and unconscious biases affect their interactions at work.

> Microaggressions strain those insecurities, and contribute to a culture where not everyone feels included. [h.](https://hyp.is/j_e5PGo1EeupCn9Vv6KYlw/www.surveymonkey.com/curiosity/microaggressions-research/www.surveymonkey.com/curiosity/microaggressions-research)

- If we are trying to build a culture of inclusiveness, belonging, and safety - we need to take microaggressions seriously and not dismiss them.

#### Who is responsible for microaggressions?

> Unsurprisingly, only 10% of the respondents believed that they’d personally _committed_ a microaggression [h.](https://hyp.is/uZoutGo1EeukjycN3IhAoQ/www.surveymonkey.com/curiosity/microaggressions-research/www.surveymonkey.com/curiosity/microaggressions-research) 

- Not surprised by this, as a common source of microaggressions is not realizing that it is a problem in the first place. Making them is common, but it's how we respond when it's pointed out, learn and aim to do better afterwards. Need to know how to rebound, and not get defensive. 


#### How employers can address microaggressions—according to their workers

> In our recent guide, “[How to measure Diversity and Inclusion for a stronger workplace,](https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/diversity-and-inclusion-guide/)”  Heidi Williams, the CTO of [tEQuitable](https://www.tequitable.com/), shared some ways that companies can proactively address microaggressions. To supplement those solutions, we asked respondents about their expectations about punishments for aggressors.

> Here’s what the data has to say:  
> 
> -   67% think the aggressor should be made to apologize
> -   47% think managers should talk to their employees about potential microaggressions
> -   40% think HR should step in
> -   30% think that aggressors should have to undergo anti-bias training (though this goes up to 40% among people who have experienced a microaggression)
> -   Only 9% think the perpetrator should be fired - [h.](https://hyp.is/CS2Ynmo2EeuOpS9mhTOdyw/www.surveymonkey.com/curiosity/microaggressions-research/www.surveymonkey.com/curiosity/microaggressions-research)

- I think that these are some interesting numbers, and that only 9% think termination is a way to address it. I think a common fear that people have when talking about these things, is that "I need to be overly PC, check what I say all the time, I can't say anything - because if I say one thing out of line - I might get fired"

## Actionable Tip

> _Take Action_ and ask your manager what sorts of resources they distribute to educate employees about microaggressions. If they don't have any, offer to share this article with them. -- Crescendo
