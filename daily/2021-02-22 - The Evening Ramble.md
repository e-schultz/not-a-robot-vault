# Trying a different approach for the ramble

[[202102221910 try a slightly different approach to the evening ramble for a few day|I might try a slightly different approach to the evening ramble for a few days]], as I'm poking around my graph, experimenting with filters/etc - everything is currently like 1 or 2 links away from connecting to a daily page.

# When to break things out?

Not sure on that - there have been some evening ramble pages that have ended up quite long, recently I've broken a few of those out into their own larger page, but haven't broken down the other parts more yet.

But, this is an ongoing part of digital garden maintenance - it's a living document that is tweaked, pruned and shaped over time.
