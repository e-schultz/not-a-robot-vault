##### [[PARA/Resource/Neurodiversity/ND]]

In short - it's a form of [[personal knowledge management]], but thinking in terms of how this fits in with ADHD / neurodiversity.

There was a long time where I had reinforced in my head that "I just need to try harder at remembering better"

As I understand myself and ADHD better, is understanding how things like short term / working memory / etc work, and how to take notes and have a system around it that let me surface information easier.

## For Example - Bookmarks are (almost) Useless

I rarely use the bookmarks in my browser, I might use things like Refind to collect things I want to read, but I need to access links to so many other things for work. 

Often when I need to find something - it helps to remember the context that it was shared in.  

I'm more inclined to remember:

> "Kyle shared the slide deck during the last one on one meeting"

Jump to my note on that, and then to the slide deck. 

When things are linked together, and when combined with my own personal note system - it's not just the link to the slide deck, but also

It's [[202102212106 encoding my understanding not just the reference|encoding my understanding of that]] artifact, not just a reference to it.
