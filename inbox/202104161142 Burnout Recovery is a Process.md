# Burnout Recovery is a Process
##### It's not always going to be linear

 Something that I need to keep in mind, and remind myself of - is recovery is a process, and it's not always going to be linear.
 
 I've been in a similar place before, and I know the setbacks that I had once I tried to jump back into things full-tilt too soon. 
 
 I remember the First Day Back On The Job when I was coming back from mental-health leave while at Rangle.

#### First Day Back On The Job

I had been off for a little over a month at the time, and during the process -** I felt really supported by Rangle, like they went above and beyond what I expected** a company could and would do, and to be honest - I think this should be the base-line of support for everyone.

During my time off, I had gotten into a pretty good routine - and a lot of that came from working within my The Happy Book, [This tweet thread](https://twitter.com/e_p82/status/1284491337539166209) goes a bit into how I've used it before. 

How I scheduled my day, kept up with tasks - I had a good routine, or ritual even - of getting through my day, and thought I would just apply that to being at work.

Somehow in the process though, I ended up coming up with the most rigidly structured plan for my day, and it didn't go as planned. 

I remember arriving at work, and HR wasn't there, my manager wasn't there - I was feeling anxious about coming back already, and found a quiet desk in an empty part of the office and** sat there, frozen for the entire day.**

It was basically a day long anxiety attack.


I then go home, next day - I despite my best efforts, I couldn't make it into the office.

#### Attempt at Day Two

I had woken up, did my morning routine - and started to head towards the office. I was already feeling a little on edge because of the day before, but I had gotten a message that HR and my manager would be in the office that day.

I was walking to work, it was a bright and sunny day, the streets were busy with people, but sensory overload was starting to creep in.

As I was walking past a building, two people in giant metal ball suits advertising Lotto Max or something come out, start banging on their metal suits loudly trying to get peoples attention. 

I was already feeling overwhelmed, and the sudden noise pushed me over the edge - and found a quiet spot as quickly as I could, I think it was the lobby of an office building near King. 

It had felt like my head shattered, like my brain had broke - and I needed to just sit in a cool, calm, quiet place and not be bothered by anyone for awhile. 

Once I started to recover, I sent an email saying that I was going home and wouldn't be in.

Work responded saying no problem, and to take the time that I need, and it wasn't until nearly the end of day Friday until I finally got back in.

#### Maybe we didn't do this right

I had intended to go into the office on Friday, it took me until about 4:30pm until I got there, I remember talking with HR - who has been very supportive, and after seeing how I was doing, one of the first things that they said:

> "After talking with your manager, we realized that we didn't do the best by you in supporting you coming back to work"

One thing I would like to note though, is when making the choice of when to come back to work - that was up to me. I didn't feel pressured, or like I had to rush.

We had talked about having a modified work schedule for coming back to work, instead of full-time M-F - it was a reduced one, that was something like:

- Half Days Mon/Tues, Thurs/Fri
- Weds - flex day - could be a full day, could be a day off, could be a half day.

For the type of work that I was doing, and getting assigned to - also fit with that schedule, and helped play a big role in getting back on my feet and feeling confident at work again.

It was also during this time, when the idea of  wanting to learn how to teach better started to take better form.

%%[[I wanted to learn how to teach better]] / [[Learning How To Teach Better]] %%

One of the things I appreciated, is they were willing to do this without a doctors note, even though I needed one for myself.

#### Therapists Note Not Required for Work, but - for me.

I really appreciated that work believed me, they took me at my word for the challenges I was having. When talking about the modified work schedule, they were the ones who had bought it up - and also, had said that they didn't need any notes from a therapist.

However, for myself - I wanted that therapists note, even though I knew it wasn't required for work. 

I'm lucky enough that I have access to a few therapists, two through Mount Sinai, and a program for HIV+ men - and I've been seeing them on and off for nearly a decade now.

**It was a permission slip for myself**, even with work willing to be accommodating, there was still a sense of guilt and shame about making use of that accommodation. Having my therapist be no - this makes sense, and sounds right - and also surprised at how supportive my work was being. 

If I didn't have access to. therapy, or couldn't have gotten the note - I would have still made use of the modified schedule back to work, but having that level of support and understanding, made me feel confident in being able to actually make use of it.
