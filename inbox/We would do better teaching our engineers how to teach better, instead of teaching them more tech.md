- Thinking back to early Rangle, we did invest in things like
	- Coaching, mentoring
	- Bringing in people to help people learn how to coach
	- The 'meta workshop' / 'train the trainer'
	- When talking with someone from Rangle recently, I was talking about the idea of teaching / teaching culture - and '[[teaching people how to teach]]', they said they hadn't really seen it been done before / not sure how to approach that, but - there are aspects of that, that we have done before.
