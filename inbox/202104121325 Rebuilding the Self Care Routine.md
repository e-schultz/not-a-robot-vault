# Rebuilding the Self Care Routine

[[202103091935 that time I burned out at Rangle|When I burned out at Rangle]], it took me awhile to get back on my feet - and even then, it was never quite a fully recovery, and it took a long time until I could get back into a full work schedule, even once I did return to work. ^677a07

The last few weeks have been very much rest, recharge, reflect - and now going into week four, starting to need to plan a few things.

Going back to my The Happy Book Journal for keeping up with basic daily self-care tasks like meditation, chores, etc - some things I don't always need a digital record of. 

and, then - need to start planning on what to do next 

- Register a business
- Figure out how much money I have to support myself while unemployed
- Business plan
- Contacting people
- Taxes / etc - ugh

I keep alternating between wanting to run really fast, and tackle things right now - vs recognizing that I need the time to recharge a bit, and that recovery is going to come in cycles.
