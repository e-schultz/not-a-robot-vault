-   Isolation during the pandemic has me thinking alot about this.
    -   I'm wondering how many times what I was thinking anxiety was me l needing a quiet dim rooms, but not able to access one easily.
    -   Now thats my quiet dim room is feet away and available all day... [twitter.com/elisekumar/sta‚Ä¶](https://twitter.com/elisekumar/status/1357212563356852226)
-   Old office had a quiet room, and a meditation / wellness room - but they weren't always available.
    -   Sometimes if I couldn't access one easily - I'd end up going for a walk, sometimes ending up at home ![üòê](https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/v/13.0.1/72x72/1f610.png)
-   Also at times - when I thought I was getting a headache / sick - was it light sensitivity issues?
    
    -   Being able to time out in a dim room for a bit helps so much with that.
-   I also get anxious about going to the grocery store - and have made use of the days they over reduced stimulation at times.
    -   Sometimes I'm fine at the grocery store, other times it's sensory hell that exhausts me.
-   But now - it's not uncommon for a couple of times a week, sometimes a day for me to go for short sensory times outs during work since I live alone and a bed and a blanket are within arms reach.
-   I've also been thinking about the differences between autistic / Hyperfocus / neurodiverse causes of burnout vs I guess work burnout.
    -   They can be related - but also very different things.
-   They can happen independently of eachother - but can also trigger / worsen eachother.
-   Like I can be feeling "work burnt out" - but still have energy for life at the end of the day.
    -   Meltdown / shutdown burnout - making the choice to go grocery shopping or to the conscience store feels like an impossible choice, let alone doing it.
-   It's hard to function - sensory sensitivity issues go onto overdrive, regulations is out the window.
    -   I can end up going kinda non-verbal for a few days, stutter gets worse.
    -   But it's like the intensity volume on reality got cranked to 11 and I need isolation
-   Trying to push through it is like masking effort X 100 - and I can start to feel sick.
    -   And it's like - "I'm a 38yr old grown ass man, basic self care shouldn't be so difficult", but here I am.
-   I've been on the stimulation burnout edge to the point where my cat meowing at me has caused fill on meltdown and ruined a day.
    -   Normally he's a cute fella and not a problem.
    -   Some days I've collapsed to the floor sobbing because it felt like it broken my brain.
-   There probably isn't a person I work with that hadn't heard Uncle Handsome meow by now.
    -   Most days not a problem,
    -   Also feeling more comfortable to walk around and see what he wants even if it's during a meeting
-   "one sec - need to deal with the cat"
    -   And get him a treat / water / sometimes he just wants attention.
    -   But earlier on I'd try to ignore it until the meeting was done, and by the end it'd feel like daggers in my ear drums.
-   It'd break attention, trying to stay focused was hard, the constant context switching hurt my head.
    -   The meow might as well as been a 5sec fog horn - and I'd quickly try to catch back upto the meeting, while feeling stressed and disoriented.
-   Have that happen multiple times a day, sometimes per meeting and...
    -   It sucks.
-   I'm getting more comfortable talking about what's going on at work - have sent links to a few of my slack threads.
    -   Now and then I still feel this self conscious insecurity of
    -   "am I just looking to make excuses for myself?"
    -   I'm not.
-   But that kind of messaging has been so drilled into my head it's hard not to blame myself
    -   Learning to be honest about it
    -   how to advocate for myself,
    -   get the accommodations that I need
    -   Is a learning process.
-   I'm not just complaining about what's being difficult, but also trying to figure out solutions.
    -   Sometimes I need to vent though to figure out what those solutions can look like
