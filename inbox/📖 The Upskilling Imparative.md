# [[The Upskilling Imparative]]


### Part 1 - Introducing the era of Continuous Learning

#### 1. Why are we talking about Learning at Work?

The rate of change, and need to be continuously learning is new-ish, and often viewed as something done outside of work, or once done higher education - then 'learning is done'.

Expecting learning, development and career growth to be done outside of work is no longer feasible for many people, and at the same time - are not sure what skills they should be learning, how to demonstrate competencies to their managers.

Traditional top-down instructor / HR lead learning initiatives do not scale to meet the needs of learners.

> Smart companies respond to this trend by doing more to help employees navigate winding career paths and gain the skills that will keep them moving forward. Not simply a "nice thing to do", supporting employee learning and development is a proven business driver. -- David Mallhom, High Impact Learning Culture - The 40 Best Pratices for creating an Empowered Enterprise tk
