Hello. I am a queer person in a film. 

##### My life has been reduced to trauma

^6d12e1

My life has been reduced to trauma[^1365681396728135681], normal aspects of my life are portrayed as devious and self-destructive.

I discover my sense of self-worth when I fall in love for the first time, and match the heteronormative expectations of dating.

I hate how aspects of queer culture get demonized in even 'LGBTQ+' movies 

Like it's impossible to give a portrayal of sex, clubs, parties, cruising, drugs without projecting some sort of judgement on it.

- "Oh no, Brian went for "a jog" in the woods to get a BJ,  he's being self-destructive, looking for validation and does not accept himself"

- "Oh no, Brian did molly at the club - he's filling a void in his life with drugs and partying and is going to hit rock bottom"

- "Oh yay, Brian found Kyle - and they are now having cute picnics in the park around all of the other heterosexuals, have candlelit dinners, and never fuck in the darkroom of a bar, that's true love - Brian now loves himself"
