I've never really thought of math in terms of racism/anti-racism before, so when I saw [this tweet](https://twitter.com/LauraFMcConnell/status/1363961835217682433/photo/1), it made me a little curious.

The screenshot is from a digital toolkit released by [Equitablemath](https://equitablemath.org/), and it contains five documents that they call strides to help work towards an anti-racist math curriculum 

# Equitable Math's Five Strides

Equitable Math have released five documents for a pathway to equitable math instruction.

- Stride 1 - Dismantling Racism in Mathematics Instruction - [pdf](https://equitablemath.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/11/1_STRIDE1.pdf)
- Stride 2 -  Fostering Deep Understanding [pdf](https://equitablemath.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/11/2_STRIDE2.pdf)
- Stride 3 - Creating Conditions to Thrive - [zip file](https://west.edtrust.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/3_STRIDE3.zip)
- Stride 4 - Connecting Critical Intersections - [pdf](https://equitablemath.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/11/4_STRIDE4.pdf)
- Stride 5 - Sustaining Equitable Practice - [pdf](https://equitablemath.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/11/5_STRIDE5.pdf)

# Questions I had

I did a quick skim of Stride 1, but it's a rather lengthy ~82 page document, but two things I wondered was:

- What is the age / grade range is this targeted at?
- Is this geared towards North America / USA Specifically? 

## What is the grade range is this targeted at?

> Nearly two dozen organizations, including teachers, instructional coaches, researchers in higher education and experts from nonprofits and offices of education recently contributed to the creation of a [digital toolkit](https://equitablemath.org/#about) for anti-racist instructional practices for ==teaching math in grades 6-8. Coverage includes guidance for teachers implementing hybrid and remote learning==. The project was led by the [Education Trust-West](https://west.edtrust.org/), which advocates for "educational justice and high academic achievement" for and among California students. [^2]

- Grades 6-8

## Is this geared towards North America / USA Specifically?

> Although the toolkit is ==focused on California and relied primarily on contributors in the state==, much of the content would be applicable to educators in any location. [^2]

- Being focused on Grades 6-8 in the states, although it could be applicable anywhere. 

### Why does this question matter?

The initial tweet that got my attention, was from someone in Scotland - and understanding a bit of the context of North American, especially American education system matters.

Some education systems focus more on rote learning and memorization, and schools in the USA have pressure to teach to pass the standardized testing, which has it's own issues with systemic racism. 

### USA - Rote Learning

> Research shows that an emphasis on memorization, rote procedures and speed impairs learning and achievement [^7]

>  Why? Because American schools routinely present mathematics procedurally, as sets of steps to memorize and apply. Many teachers, faced with long lists of content to cover to satisfy state and federal requirements, worry that students do not have enough time to explore math topics in depth [^6]
