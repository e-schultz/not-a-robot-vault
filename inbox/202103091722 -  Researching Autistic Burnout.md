## [[autistic burnout]]: The Cost of Masking and Passing

it does feel like there is a cycle of this going on - keep building coping mechanisms / systems, and then they keep crumbling. 

This has been made worse by the pandemic, remote work, isolation.

- self care has been falling
- can be days when I barely leave bed
- have gone days forgetting to shower 
- place is clean-ish, but that's slipping 
- just having the energy to take care of base-level things is draining all my spoons

### Highlights
> _Autistic burnout is a state of physical and mental fatigue, heightened stress, and diminished capacity to manage life skills, sensory input, and/or social interactions, which comes from years of being severely overtaxed by the strain of trying to live up to demands that are out of sync with our needs._

>  “A state of pervasive exhaustion, loss of function, increase in autistic traits, and withdrawal from life that results from continuously expending more resources than one has coping with activities and environments ill-suited to one’s abilities and needs.” In other words, autistic burnout is the result of being asked to continuously do more than one is capable of without sufficient means for recovery.

>These periods of burnout caused problems at school and work. I would lose executive function and self-care skills. My capacity for sensory and social overload dwindled to near nothing. I avoided speaking and retreated from socializing. I was spent. I couldn’t [maintain the facade](https://thisthatandvera.wordpress.com/2015/10/12/an-anomaly-a-facade-and-vera/) anymore. I had to stop and pay the price.
