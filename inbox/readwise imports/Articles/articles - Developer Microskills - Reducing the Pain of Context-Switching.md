- The biggest problem with context-switching is the drag it introduces in the time between idea and execution. It‚Äôs hard to be creative when you‚Äôre doing a bunch of prep work to get your mind right. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1390900503/15654854))
    - **Note:** I've called this cognitive sludge before
- but switching over to content and developer relations was a big shock to me on that front. At any given time, I could be:
  Writing a blog post
  Answering questions on Twitter, Slack, Discord, or various Discourse forums
  Making videos
  Figuring out how to integrate Auth0 with X language or Y framework
  Building and improving programs like Auth0 Ambassadors
  Collaborating with other companies on content
  Building a talk
  Applying to events
  Giving a talk (whether in person or online) ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1390900503/15654865))
    - **Note:** Some of the work that developer advocate / devrel does 
      .... I've enjoyed doing most of these at some point
- One of the biggest hurdles of switching contexts I‚Äôve found is that I tend to go through the same mental startup process (sometimes called ‚Äúcognitive setup‚Äù) over and over again on a project. This led to me having the same ideas multiple times because I was going down the same roads I had gone down before. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1390900503/15654881))
    - **Note:** If you have lost context, or forgotten what you have already done (can also be an issue with ADHD and forgetting about things that you wanted to do or already doing)
- I had an ‚Äúaha‚Äù moment last year when I came across Tiago Forte‚Äôs concept of ‚Äúslow burns vs heavy lifts.‚Äù Instead of having to spend several hours at a time doing all of the cognitive setup for a project and doing the creative work on it, you can spread that work out little by little and find ways to keep the context of the project fresh in your mind. (Here‚Äôs a useful summary of Tiago‚Äôs main ideas in this area.) ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1390900503/15654900))
    - **Note:** Expand on Some of the things I do 
      - leave bread crumbs 
      - densely link notes / ideas 
      - contextual links 
      - note review 
      - make small changes over time 
      - document almost everything 
      - have ways to surface old but related content in new ways 
      - treating my main notes as an evolving document
- You can put these in physical journals, one app, or multiple apps. I‚Äôve found that no single app can adequately do everything I need. In fact, I have 3 main Sources of Truth:
  Notion for timely status updates
  Drafts for jotting down ideas or notes that I can categorize later (a huge blocker for creativity is that mental setup of having to think about where to put an idea as you‚Äôre having it)
  Obsidian for archives, notes, and research (aka ‚Äú[[Knowledge Management]]‚Äù)
  You can go really deep into knowledge management; just google [[üí° - Zettelkasten|Zettelkasten]] and you‚Äôll see what I mean. If you want to check out Obsidian for yourself, here‚Äôs a great tutorial on Obsidian for beginners. Many people who get into this space also recommend learning about how to take good notes. I haven‚Äôt done this myself yet, but a book that always comes up is How to Take Smart Notes. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1390900503/15654909))
    - **Note:** The other night I was writing more about my personal knowledge stack
- Review Regularly
  Centralizing your inputs is only half the battle here. Probably the most overlooked but most productive thing you can do to help with context-switching is reviewing your projects and notes regularly. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1390900503/15654912))
- I spend a decent amount of time in Drafts and Obsidian taking notes each day, so while I‚Äôm in there I try to do some ‚Äúdigital gardening.‚Äù I‚Äôll move things around, review what‚Äôs in my Drafts inbox and move it over to Obsidian, or clean up my notes on whatever I‚Äôm working on. This knowledge management stuff is definitely something you have to do gradually, otherwise you‚Äôll get overwhelmed and burn out. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1390900503/15654923))
    - **Note:** Digital gardening - and resisting the urge to try and do everything at once, can pick away at it over time
- As I mentioned in the issue on reviewing your progress, regular review has many benefits: ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1390900503/15654926))
- It helps us predict the future by noticing patterns. If I‚Äôm paying close attention to what I‚Äôm doing and where I‚Äôm blocked, I can start to notice patterns and come up with experiments I can try. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1390900503/15654927))
    - **Note:** üëÄ
- It clears the junk from our heads. We can only juggle so many things in our heads. By regularly noticing what we‚Äôre thinking about and where we‚Äôre spending time, we‚Äôll start to drop things that aren‚Äôt helping us. Having a clear idea of the status of what we‚Äôre working on is a huge timesaver when it comes to context-switching. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1390900503/15654933))
    - **Note:** Morning pages / evening ramble are also useful for brain dumps and clearing the working memory
- I learned a trick from David Sparks on how to use the Mac automation software Keyboard Maestro to create palettes of shortcuts grouped by context and it was a huge game-changer for this. I can hit ‚Äúctrl-cmd-opt-B‚Äù to bring up a bunch of business related shortcuts to launch particular websites, open repos in VS Code, or open a project in Notion. It looks like this: ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1390900503/15654950))
- If you want to learn how to do it, I wrote a blog article with an embedded egghead video.
  My best advice with automation is to start slow; notice where you are getting distracted and gradually build automations that save you some steps. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1390900503/15654958))
    - **Note:** This is how I started with roam, and now Obsidian - trying templates, using the hot keys more, trying different workflows
- Some Updates from Me
  I‚Äôm making good progress on the Guide to Tiny Experiments, which is my upcoming book on how to finish what you start. About 50 people have pre-ordered the book, which is super exciting and a huge honor! In addition to the special pre-order price of $10, pre-order folks will get early access to some of the material and some insights into my writing process.
