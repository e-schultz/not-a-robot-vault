- AlejandraAlejandra Luaces had only worked at Mailchimp for four months when she got a surprising anonymous email. “Oliver* is in an open marriage and is fair game,” the message read, referring to a senior engineering manager. “Serena* also knows so you can ask her to confirm.”
    - **Note:** when we encourage to bring their 'whole selves to work' - but then gets weaponized against them in a rumour mill - people don't feel safe
- After they returned to Atlanta, Oliver sent her a message saying he’d thought they were going to hook up on the trip. Luaces responded that she didn’t think it was a good idea. Shortly after, the offer to move to his team seemingly evaporated. Luaces’ role was being eliminated in the reorg, and she was told she could either take a lower-level position or leave the company.

      power dynamic and imbalance - give into sexual advances, or be penalized for it - neither are appropriate.
- In the offer letter for the new role, Mailchimp managers told Luaces that she would not be eligible for a pay raise for “at least the next year, and maybe a few years.” The letter also said that while Luaces was a hard worker, “the perception is that you will fill your time with non-work related activities if your task list is not full.”
- Offer letter Mailchimp sent to Alejandra Luaces for an internal transfer.

- Employees say the company’s __position as one of the premier startups in Atlanta allows it to view workers as disposable, as there are fewer tech jobs to choose from__ than if the company were located in San Francisco or New York City.
  They also say that because the organization is private and has never taken on outside investment, executives can operate without the specter of more public accountability. __Many feel they’ve exhausted every option internally and are only speaking to the press as a last resort__.

      "If you don't like it, just leave" is something I'll hear people say - being unaware that
      - leaving may not be a valid option
      - other opportunities may not be there
      - just leaving allows the toxic culture to continue
- In a statement emailed to The Verge, a Mailchimp spokesperson said: “We’ve always wanted Mailchimp to be a place where everyone feels included, respected, and empowered to do their best work. But that hasn’t been the experience for all of our employees. Over the past four years we’ve doubled in size, and while we worked hard to foster an inclusive culture as we grew, we fell short in some important areas.” The company declined to comment on The Verge’s questions about individual personnel matters.
    - **Note:** Guiding Principles - Lack of Inclusion is a Risk / Crisis Management issue
- Stories about Mailchimp’s company culture began circulating on February 17th, 2021, after a principal engineer, Kelly Ellis, posted a viral tweet thread about her decision to leave. She said she’d dealt with “sexism and bullying” and was underpaid compared to male colleagues. (Ellis did not respond to a request for comment from The Verge.)
- Mailchimp told employees that it had investigated Ellis’ claims and found them to be unsubstantiated. But CEO Ben Chestnut also said that he knew the company needed to do better. “I’m hearing loud and clear that we have work to do, including needing greater transparency around pay equity and an intentional focus on inclusion,” he wrote in a letter to staffers, which was first reported in Business Insider. “I want to address these issues head-on, and I know we’ll be stronger for it. I’m asking our leadership team to prioritize these issues and work with me to fix them. What we do needs to match what we say.”
    - **Note:** saying and doing are different things.
- Group chats and Slack groups filled with former Mailchimp employees were set ablaze by the news. Workers began discussing their own experiences with alleged discrimination and unequal pay, wondering whether what they viewed as the open secret of Mailchimp’s company culture would finally be brought into the open. “They’re going to have to acknowledge the problems that are being raised, and respond with something other than, ‘we have investigated ourselves and found we did nothing wrong,’” one said in an alumni Slack. “I wish more people would speak out but I wont for the same reasons (NDA, fear of retaliation),” another responded.
    - **Note:** often the people not being harmed, are not aware that there is a problem - operating from a position of privilege, and then gaslighting victims
- Dale remembers that once, a manager shushed her when she responded to a question she’d been asked directly during a meeting with him and another male colleague. He then asked her male counterpart to answer the question. She says that when she went to HR to tell them about the behavior, nothing seemed to change. “Leadership at Mailchimp clearly knows about this and doesn’t do anything about it,” she says.
    - **Note:** 202102271101
      - being aware, but not caring, or not believing it's a problem
      - can lead to people not reporting if they feel nothing will be done
- In response to this allegation, Mailchimp said no formal HR complaints have been filed against the manager in question.
    - **Note:** if people fear that raising issues will impact their growth, lack of reporting does not mean lack of a problem
- A female leader who left the company in 2019 said she was repeatedly given what she viewed as gendered feedback and promised promotions that never materialized. Once, when she pushed back on a comment her manager made in a review, he said, “Don’t contradict me in front of the kids,” referring to her direct reports. He also would tell her to “be more professional” when she disagreed with him in meetings. The woman says she reported these experiences to HR, but nothing changed. Eventually, she found out she was making roughly $100,000 less than a male colleague just one level above her who did comparable work, and she decided to quit. She asked to remain anonymous due to fear of retaliation.
- “The support team was treated like the custodians,” a former staffer says. “Everyone loves and respects the custodian. They’re a friendly face when you walk in the door. But no one has any interest in promoting the custodian.”
  “It feels like you’re the lowest rung on the ladder,” a current employee adds. “When you see people of color, women, LGBTQ people in this department it feels really shitty. We’re hidden away.”
    - **Note:** - hiring people / inviting people in is one thing
      - that does not mean that they feel included, or that they belong
- For Angelo Ragin, however, Ellis’ experience was validating. He’d voiced some of the same concerns in 2014 when he’d advocated for a pay raise and was told he was being entitled. His concerns about pay, while old, are echoed by current Mailchimp staffers. 
  Ragin was the first Black employee at Mailchimp. He started on the tech support team in 2009 before moving to the IT department. The role fit Ragin’s background: he’d previously worked on the Geek Squad at Best Buy and was an expert in Apple software and products.
- One of the key metrics on the IT team was how many tickets agents solved. Mailchimp employees would write in with technical issues, and it was up to the team to resolve them as quickly as possible.
    - **Note:** 202102271102
      measure the wrong metrics for the wrong things - get results you don't want. Don't confuse metrics for goals
- In his review in 2014, his manager said that the company had already bumped him up 14 percent, and “with bonuses, company-paid health insurance and other perks the total compensation package easily puts Angelo well on the way, if not already in excess of, his $80K/year long term goal.” He refused to further increase Ragin’s pay. Ragin was then chided for advocating for himself.
    - **Note:** we encourage people to speak up, advocate for themselves - but depending on our privilege, and the other person - what can be seem normal for a white person, can be seen as greedy, self serving, etc if asked by other groups
- Feedback Angelo Ragin got from a manager in 2014.
- Another manager wrote in the review: “Management definitely recognizes his efforts and successes but these can be overshadowed when he displays what some might perceive as a sense of entitlement. He needs to be subtler when it comes to voicing his opinion about his compensation.”
  The following year, Mailchimp recorded $280 million in revenue, according to The New York Times.
    - **Note:** - "Speak up, but not like that"
- Earlier on in his tenure, Ragin had taken a week off due to a difficult situation in his family. When he returned to the office, he says he was called out for not responding to tickets while he was away. “That crushed me,” he says. “I was just like ‘are you serious?’ Especially because I’m your token Black kid, I’m the one you put on a poster when you go to job fairs to say you’re diverse. You’re not diverse, you just have me here.”
    - **Note:** - not caring about the person
      - not being aware of what is going on
      - unfair penalty for dealing with personal issues
      - often this can be unfairly used against some groups, but a pass for others
- Ragin was also beginning to tire of small slights that piled up from white colleagues. Some would greet him by saying “what’s up gangster” and joke that he was stealing computers.
    - **Note:** the cost of microaggressions in the workplace
- Ragin decided to send a letter to Mailchimp’s co-founders to voice his concerns. “It’s hard to walk into a company you love and have loved for so long, feeling like you’re going to do your best to have a good day but you’re expecting some sort of uncomfortable comment from someone and you just have to swallow your feelings for the sake of not being labeled as ‘aggressive’ or ‘defensive’ by your peers so you just keep quiet,” he wrote.
- Mailchimp eventually decided to roll out unconscious bias training and enlisted Ragin’s support. He was glad to advise on the curriculum but was not compensated for the extra work.
    - **Note:** - "Please help us"
      - extra work, not paid
      - later - this can then be used as a "not doing work related tasks", and held against that person
- While the bias training is now available for all employees, some staffers say the company still has more work to do. On the anonymous forum Blind, some have been discussing a perceived exodus of Black employees in recent years. 
  Comments in Blind, an anonymous employee forum.
- Ragin says that his experience at Mailchimp even prompted him to go to therapy for depression. “I questioned myself, I questioned my work, I questioned my ability, because every time you get to the next level, they move the bar,” he explains.
