- In the context of L&D, learning ecosystem gives us a way to talk about your organization’s learning infrastructure: all the people, systems, tools, and technology that enable learning at your organization.
- Creating harmony and balance in workplace learning takes an organized, concerted effort. In order to achieve the learning ecosystem vision, you must build, implement, and maintain it. ^86aa5c
    - **Note:** At a smaller scale, a-lot of this can happen organically - but it needs dedicated effort to maintain and scale, we can't just hope it happens. ^c8d046
- 1. Assign roles to the people in your learning ecosystem
- CLO and other L&D team members facilitate the learning ecosystem
- The major responsibility of employees in a learning ecosystem is to learn. But they can’t just aimlessly surf through learning content; they must pursue measurable learning goals that align with personal and business OKRs. And they must pay attention to gaps in their learning content and communicate them to managers and L&D — this kind of communication helps L&D perpetually assess and fulfill training needs. ^1813b0
    - **Note:** I've seen learning courses in a way, that is 'here is a budget, and go watch some video's 
      and when it's not suited to their needs, or able to apply it to what they are working on right now, it's more like edutainment - learned a thing, but now back to my real work. ^5b4824
- help employees set learning goals,suggest learning paths,highlight learning opportunities that compliment day-to-day workmonitor and encourage progress, andstep in to resolve obstacles as needed.
- 2. Choose a learning tool that facilitates peer-to-peer knowledge flow
- If you want to create a healthy learning ecosystem, you need to facilitate a continuous, autonomous flow of learning. Otherwise, you won’t have a learning ecosystem at all, but a regular, L&D-dependent structure. How do you achieve that flow of learning? Peer-driven tools, which give employees the power to learn from one another. ^0698ca
    - **Note:** we want to facilitate and enable learning, not be barriers to it. ^b61e38
- “Employees use social media and search in their spare time to satisfy their curiosity, right when they need it,” says Elisabetta Galli, Global Head of Knowledge, Development, and Talent Management at Banco Santander. “It should be exactly the same at work ... This is our vision: to create a learning-in-the-flow-of-work ecosystem and become a learning organization, whose workforce is upskilled in real time.”
- How do you achieve learning in the flow of work? By giving your employees tools to create, share, and iterate learning content directly (and in turn, freeing L&D to focus on higher-level strategy, not just content creation). In other words, by tapping into Collaborative Learning. ^1c2e6d
- When employees can create, share, and iterate learning content autonomously, you can cut out the go-between (L&D) and avoid needless back-and-forth and bottlenecking. ^3000bb
- Plus, when subject-matter experts are empowered to easily share their institutional knowledge in a new course, it’s easier to maintain a library of relevant, up-to-date learning content. ^6e663d
- 3. Align and measure your learning ecosystem against business goals
- Natural ecosystems have only one imperative: biological survival. Learning ecosystems don’t fight biological survival, but they do need to maintain ROI and align with business goals in order to stay viable. ^22efe3
