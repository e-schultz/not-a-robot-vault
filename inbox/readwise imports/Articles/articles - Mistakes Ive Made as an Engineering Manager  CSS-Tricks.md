- But before diving in, I want to mention a strong caveat that my advice may be unique to my situation because I’m white and a woman in tech. My experiences may be relevant to that point of view, but your mileage may vary
    - **Note:** This is something that I wish more people were aware of when giving advice - is how thier privilege can impact thier perspective
- Mistake 1: Thinking people give feedback the way they want to receive it
  Feedback is one of the most important tools you have as a manager, but it can also be incredibly disruptive with poor execution. One of the hardest things I’ve had to learn is that humans aren’t pure functions: an input that works one day and gets one result, then again another day and get an entirely different result.
    - **Note:** Humans are not pure functions - ❤️ that.
      Another mistake I made early on was assuming everyone liked to be managed the same way
- Mistake 2: Trying to do everything yourself as a manager is the best way to help
    - **Note:** This extends beyond being hands on and doing the IC work. 
      Things like helping people advocate for themselves / etc are also important things
- But even more than that, what became very clear to me was that all of that “protection” I thought I had set up for her didn’t really serve her well for the long haul. For example, I didn’t teach her how to advocate for herself or how to navigate the system. I vowed never to make that mistake again.
- This is tough! If you’re strong and care about your team as people, it can feel very unnatural to teach someone to advocate instead of moving things out of their way themselves. And the point is not to throw that person into the fire. The point is to care. Are you teaching the things they need to learn? Are they really growing under you? Feeling like you’re protecting someone at all costs also lead to your own ego trip, too, which threatens progress.
    - **Note:** At times feeling good isn't the same as doing good
- Try to think through what skills someone needs to succeed without you. Teach those things incrementally. Sure, this is easy advice to say, but it’s really hard to do in the thick of things. Spend some time with it, and think through ways you can inject that learning into everyday work and interactions.
- Mistake 3: Communicating something one time is enough
  No one likes to feel like they’re repeating themselves. It’s annoying to say someone more than once, and it’s annoying to hear something over and again. But if you have a big enough group and there’s enough going on, things are going to slip through the cracks, so repetition becomes an important tool to make things stick. The trick is to say the same things, but in different ways.
    - **Note:** I've said this before, and I still make this mistake sometimes.
      - repeat it often 
      - in different ways 
      - in different contexts 
      - reinforce it 
      - when repeating connect it to other things 
      Assuming because it was said once that it was heard isn't enough.
      Even if you get a "sure/yeah" back - maybe they didn't understand.
      Think: neurodiverse at work / neurodiverse work - saying yes while in Hyperfocus and over committing without realizing it
- Not a chance. I was the one who wasn’t clear. In fact, you can probably guess that if a whole group of people don’t understand or take action, the chance is that you, the manager, are the common denominator for why something is blocked
    - **Note:** Clarity enables action
- I didn’t align anyone with the why of the purpose of the task. It’s pretty easy to forget or not prioritize doing something if you have no clue why you’re doing it. Repeat yourself and align the group with the importance of the task and you’ll likely have a better result.
    - **Note:** Ask why / begin with why / if you don't understand what yourself - figure it out.
      This was a bit of a blocker when I started at a new company - I didn't know the why yet to try and connect it myself
- Mistake 4: You have to have everything together all the time
  Some folks think that management looks like a steel fortress of preparedness and authority. I’m not so sure about that.
    - **Note:** At times I think I'm ontop of things, other times the Imposter syndrome is high
