- Audio Queuing and Hyperfocus/Mind-Wandering ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1386871991/15492046))
- Common anecdotal Auditory Processing Issues (not sure this is related to the specific Auditory Processing Disorder). These are some less known presentations (even among people with ADHD/Autism), that I have observed in myself and I have had others say they relate to. The only science here that discusses these effects are to do with the cocktail effect and group situations(I’ll explain below).
  I like to refer to these processes as Audio Queuing ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1386871991/15492048))

- What is audio queuing?
  Audio queuing is the process of hearing speech from others during tasks we are concentrated on and queuing it for retrieval, or in some cases allowing that audio input to interrupt and override what we are doing. Sometimes this information isn’t stored (ie we are not actually listening at all), but a lot of the times when you assume we haven’t heard – we have – it’s just lost in processing somewhere. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1386871991/15492055))
    - **Note:** This kind of sounds a bit like the unconscious yes that leads to over commitment for me.
      I'm focused, asked to do something - say yes without realizing it, and /or completely forget what I said yes to moments later
- I’ll explain my hypothesised category of presentations.
  Subtypes of Audio Queuing
  latent queuing
  retrieval and recognition
  override and interrupt ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1386871991/15492057))
- Latent queuing:
  The first presentation is what I like to call latent queuing. Our brains are processing a lot of information all the time – with increased sensory sensitivity we take a lot more in. When we are in hyperfocus, we will often queue what has been said to us to answer after.
  Sometimes this can literally take hours to do. The information is stored somewhere by our brains, and then retrieved when it believes our queue of more important tasks is finished. I’ve answered questions hours later and had to give context. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1386871991/15492067))
    - **Note:** I can relate to this alot, happens alot if I'm asked if I have any questions after a meeting.
      My brain is still processing.
- Retrieval and recognition
  The second part about audio queuing is that quite often we will be accused of “not listening” – this can happen, but there’s also another thing that happens with queuing. We will ask you to repeat yourself or to clarify – it’s suddenly all there after the first word
  The first syllable primes the memory that we didn’t know about for retrieval. Unfortunately – this means we usually interrupt you to say “yes we have got it” – people then think that you are rude because you don’t care. But we actually know what you’ve said.

    - **Note:** Priming effect - thinking fast and Slow
- Override and interrupt
  The third way the queue works is when we are typing or writing out information – this is known as overriding and interrupting for me. If you talk to me when I am typing. I will process your audio by typing out what you have said unconsciously. Your audio has hacked our language brain ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1386871991/15492082))
    - **Note:** I find if I'm typing notes for a meeting it's so easy to end up trying to write things down verbatim.
      If someone is trying to talk to me about something unrelated - I can't quickly switch between the two
- Major ways this effect influences us in everyday life ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1386871991/15492083))
- Music
  Lyrical content is usually extremely hard to listen to and perform a task at the same time ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1386871991/15492085))
    - **Note:** I tend to dislike music with lyrics in general
- The Cocktail Effect
  The cocktail effect is the ability to listen to only one conversation in a room full of people. For me, even a second set of people having a conversation close to me is a nightmare as I parse both the conversations at the same time ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1386871991/15492088))
    - **Note:** In group settings and parties I continually pair off to smaller and smaller groups as the party grows
- This has been observed in science, but not really explained as to why this occurs. They refer to it as a ‘filtering’ issue but I believe it’s more a processing issue. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1386871991/15492090))
