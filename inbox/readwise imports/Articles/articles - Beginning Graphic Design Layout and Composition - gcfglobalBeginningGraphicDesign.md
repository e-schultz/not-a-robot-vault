  Layout and Composition
- What is composition?
  In many ways, layout and composition are the building blocks of design. They give your work structure and make it easier to navigate, from the margins on the sides to the content in between.
- Five basic principles
    - **Note:** * Proximity
      * White Space
      * Alignment
      * Contrast
      * Repetition
- Proximity
  Proximity is all about using visual space to show relationships in your content. In practice, it's pretty simple—all you have to do is make sure related items are grouped together (for instance, blocks of text or elements in a graphic, as in the example below).
- White space
  White space is an important part of every composition. Now, this doesn't mean literal white space; it just means negative space, like the spaces between your content, between lines, and even the outer margins.
- Alignment
  Alignment is something you deal with all the time, even if you don't realize it. Whenever you type an email or create a document, the text is aligned automatically.
- Contrast
  Contrast simply means that one item is different from another. In layout and composition, contrast can help you do many things, like catch the reader's eye, create emphasis, or call attention to something important.
- Repetition
  Repetition is a reminder that every project should have a consistent look and feel. This means finding ways to reinforce your design by repeating or echoing certain elements.
