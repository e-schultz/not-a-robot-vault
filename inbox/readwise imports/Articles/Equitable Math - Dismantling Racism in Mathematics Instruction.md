- Dismantling Racism in Mathematics Instruction
- While primarily for math educa-tors, this text advocates for a collective approach to dismantling white supremacy. This school-wide approach ensures that anti-racist work is not left alone to one individual
- Leaders and coaches should use the framework during observa-tions and walkthroughs, annotat-ing the behaviors and providing targeted feedback.
- HOW TO USE THIS TOOL
- DISMANTLING WHITE SUPREMACY IN MATH CLASSROOMS
- While there is some value in students being able to complete work independently, when this is the only or most common avenue for learning or practicing, it reinforces individualism and the notion that I’m the only one.
    - **Note:** When I was in school, math was always a very individual-work thing. 
      Maybe to check and grade each other - but rarely to work collaboratively on problems as far as I can remember.
- How do I engage students in learning?
- Independent practice is valued over teamwork or collaboration.
- Though math teachers often tout the phrase “mistakes are expected, respected, inspected, and corrected,” their practices don’t always align. Teachers often treat mistakes as problems by equating them with wrongness, rather than treating them opportunities for learning—which reinforces the ideas of perfectionism (that students shouldn’t make mistakes) and paternalism
