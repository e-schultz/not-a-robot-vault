### Highlights first exported March 2, 2021 at 4:51 PM

- It’s an understandable viewpoint, considering that for 8 million years since the earliest human ancestors evolved from apes, we’ve been nomadic people, wandering the earth, chasing wild animals, and moving to wherever food was. There was always something new to see and explore.
  This sounds like an ideal environment for someone with ADHD, and research may prove that hyperactive hunter-gatherers were indeed better equipped than their peers
- ADHD and hunter-gatherers
  A study conducted at Northwestern University in 2008 examined two tribal groups in Kenya. One of the tribes was still nomadic, while the other had settled into villages. The researchers were able to identify members of the tribes who displayed ADHD traits.
- Specifically, they examined the DRD4 7R, a genetic variant that researches say is linked to novelty-seeking, greater food and drug cravings, and ADHD symptoms
- In evolutionary terms, hunter-gatherers were generalists, in that they needed to know how to do a little bit of everything to survive. This information wasn’t passed down during the hours of 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. in a classroom. It was passed down from parent to child through play, observation, and informal instruction.
- ADHD, evolution, and modern schools
  Children with ADHD quickly learn that the world isn’t going to change for them. They are often given medication to curb the unruly and distracted behavior that can cause problems in school.
- Until recently in human evolution, children took charge of their own schooling by watching others, asking questions, learning through doing, and so forth. The very structure of modern schools, Gray argues, is why many children today have trouble adjusting to social expectations
