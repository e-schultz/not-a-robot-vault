- What does it mean to be a boss?
  So, you just took on management responsibilities. Or maybe you’ve been managing for a while, but you haven’t stopped to think (or been asked to think) about power dynamics. This is common for engineering leaders. Tech, after all, is the world of, ‘We have a very flat organization’, and ‘Management is just a different role’. But no organization is completely flat and no manager is not also a boss
- Commit to continuous reflection on how you are using power
  One of the best ways you can learn to wield your own power wisely is to surround yourself with a diverse group of people: peers, friends, colleagues, coaches, therapists, employees, and family – and to earnestly and regularly seek their counsel on the question of your own behavior. And, on your own, you should continue to study and learn and consider power dynamics in the world. You should think about when and where in your life you hold authority, and when and where you do not. This is how you think explicitly about power
- Remember that you take up more space
- Watch your boundaries, and check in frequently with people about theirs (don’t dump down, check in obsessively)
- Learn to listen to what people aren’t telling you
  I was once in a conversation with a direct report who was feeling frustrated with the pace of hiring in their area of engineering. They felt safe enough with me as a manager to pretty freely express the frustration, which was great. But what they didn’t say was that if I couldn’t resolve the issue soon, they’d probably end up leaving the company. Even when you have a good relationship with your manager, that’s a very awkward conversation to have, and it risks coming across as a threat
- Actively manage the emotional burden that comes with power
  If you don’t mind being irresponsible with your power, it’s not much of an emotional burden to carry. If you do want to hold your power responsibly, then you need to accept that it will be emotionally difficult. Employees trust you with their careers, their feelings, their promotions, and their raises. It’s a big responsibility

      I really like the idea / phrasing of “manage the emotional burden that comes with power”.
      Being a manager does come with a lot of responsibility, and our employees are entrusting us with their careers, growth, etc - the impact that we have on their lives can be great, and something that it feels like many managers, especially new managers don’t realize.
