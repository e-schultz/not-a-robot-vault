- ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a senior engineer, but I‚Äôm thinking about being a manager. I really like engineering, but I feel like I‚Äôm just solving the same problems over and over and it seems like the real problems are people problems. I have to be a manager to get promoted. I hope it isn‚Äôt terrible, once I make the switch. I hear it‚Äôs terrible.‚Äù ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1388144349/15552719))
    - **Note:** What happens when the only growth from senior is into management
- Fuck the whole idea that only managers get career progression. And fuckkkk the idea you have to choose a ‚Äúlane‚Äù and grow old there. I completely reject this kind of slotting. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1388144349/15552723)) ^97c45f
- ‚ÄúYour advice is bad and you should feel bad‚Äù: ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1388144349/15552728))
- The best frontline eng managers in the world are the ones that are never more than 2-3 years removed from hands-on work, full time down in the trenches. The best individual contributors are the ones who have done time in management.
  And the best technical leaders in the world are often the ones who do both. Back and forth. Like a pendulum. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1388144349/15552738))
    - **Note:** Being able to switch between IC and management is important
- leave and start it all over again. I get antsy, I get restless. I start to feel like I know what I‚Äôm doing (‚Ä¶ a telltale sign something‚Äôs wrong). ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1388144349/15552747))
    - **Note:** Can relate - every time I start feel like I'm doing well at something, I feel like something is wrong
- It‚Äôs a good cycle for people who like early stage companies, or have ADD. But I don‚Äôt see people talking about it as a career path. So I‚Äôm here to advocate for it, as an intentional and awesome way of life. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1388144349/15552753))
    - **Note:** Neurodiverse work - work that's a good match for a neurotype
- (h/t to @sarahmei who was tweetstorming this up at the EXACT SAME TIME as i was writing this. Yes Virginia, internet feminists ARE linked by a mystical hive brain.) ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1388144349/15552755))
- On being a manager (of technical projects) ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1388144349/15552761))
    - **Note:** Notice my curiosity - expand on - manager of technical projects vs manager of people
- That‚Äôs one of the only ways you can achieve the temporary glory of a hybrid manager+tech lead. This is an unstable combination, because your engineering skills and context-sharpness are decaying the longer you do it. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1388144349/15552774))
    - **Note:** Notice my curiosity - Hybrid manager and tech lead 
      There is a difference here between that - and being a manager. Need to set clearer expectations
- You can only really improve at one of these things at a time: engineering or management. And if you‚Äôre a manager, your job is to get better at management. Don‚Äôt try to cling to your former glory. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1388144349/15552785))
    - **Note:** Improving in both at the same time is hard - learning to be a manager is hard. If your a manager your job is to be a better manager
- Management is highly interruptive, and great engineering ‚Äî where you‚Äôre learning things ‚Äî requires blocking out interruptions. You can‚Äôt do these two opposite things at once. As a manager, it is your job to be available for your team, to be interrupted. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1388144349/15552794))
    - **Note:** This is an area I have a challenge with - even following through on manager tasks tasked focus time which can be hard to get
- It is your job to choose to hand off the challenging assignments, so that your engineers can get better at engineering. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1388144349/15552797))
    - **Note:** üíØ
- On being a tech lead (of people): ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1388144349/15552798))
- Conversely: the best tech leads in the world are always the ones who done time in management. This is not because they‚Äôre always the best programmers or debuggers; it‚Äôs because they know how to get shit done, which means they know how to communicate and manage other people. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1388144349/15552805))
    - **Note:** Notice my curiosity - expand on - tech lead of people but not manager
- A tech lead is a manager ‚Ä¶ but their first priority is achieving the task at hand, not grooming and minding the humans who work on it. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1388144349/15552812))
    - **Note:** While a tech lead of people is a type of management, the focus is on achieving task at hand
- They still need the full manager toolset. They‚Äôll need to know how to rally people and teams and motivate them, or how to triage and restart a stalled project that everybody dreads. They still need to connect the dots between business objectives and technical objectives, and break down big objectives ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1388144349/15552815))
    - **Note:** Expand on the manager toolset
- into components. They need to be able to size up a junior engineer‚Äôs ability and craft a meaningful assignment, one that pushes their boundaries without crushing them ‚Ä¶ then do the same for another twenty contributors. This is management work, from the slightly shifted perspective of ‚ÄúGet Thing X Done‚Äù not ‚Äúcare for these people‚Äù. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1388144349/15552820))
    - **Note:** Manager toolset
- So these tech leads usually spend more time in meetings than building things, and they will bitch about it but do it anyway, because writing code is not the best use of their time. Tech is the easy part, herding humans is the harder part. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1388144349/15552826))
    - **Note:** I've called management, especially of engineers like herding cats üòÇ
      I don't want to code much anymore, but the meetings all day Aldo hurts for different people
- The Pendulum ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1388144349/15552829))
- We don‚Äôt talk about this nearly enough: the immense breadth and strength that accrues to engineers who make a practice of going back and forth. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1388144349/15552835))
    - **Note:** Moving between manager and tech lead / IC has value
- Being a manager teaches you how the business works. It also teaches you how people work. You will learn to have uncomfortable conversations. You will learn how to still get good work out of people who are irritated, or resentful, or who hate your guts. You will learn how to resolve conflicts, dear god will you ever learn to resolve conflicts. (Actually you‚Äôll learn to YEARN for conflicts because straightforward conflict is usually better than all the other options.) You‚Äôll go home exhausted every day and unable to articulate anything you actually did. But you did stuff. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1388144349/15552851))
    - **Note:** That feeling - of always being busy but not sure what it is I did
- Management is NOT a promotion ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1388144349/15552858))
    - **Note:** Say it louder for those in the back
- Management is not a promotion, management is a change of profession. And you will be bad at it for a long time after you start doing it. If you don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre bad at it, you aren‚Äôt doing your job. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1388144349/15552872)) ^8b7227
    - **Note:** All too often people seem to think managing is a few extra meetings ontop of your day to day
