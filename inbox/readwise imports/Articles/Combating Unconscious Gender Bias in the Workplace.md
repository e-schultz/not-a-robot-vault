- Combating Unconscious Gender Bias in the Workplace
- “Gender bias holds women back from being hired and advancing in their careers. It’s important to be aware of how that manifests,” says Raena Saddler from Lean In. That’s why Lean In created an activity that helps you combat gender bias at work. It’s called 50 Ways to Fight Bias, and the digital versions are free. Raena explains, “This activity is an engaging way to think through your own biases and call out and navigate bias when you see it in the wild.”

    - **Note:** we all have biases, conscious and unconscious - being aware of these, and knowing at what points to look out for them is important.
- Examples of gender bias—and how to take action
- Lean In outlines 50 situations in which gender bias presents in the workplace, along with why it matters, what to do, and why it happens.
- Your hiring committee favors male candidates over female candidates with very similar experience. Get ahead of this by agreeing on an ideal candidate profile at the beginning of the recruitment process, and measuring all candidates against it.
- Your team overlooks a woman for a high-profile, career-changing project because they think it would be too much responsibility after recently having a baby. Suggest that it’s better to let the new mom decide for herself whether or not she wants to take the project.
- Someone from another department incorrectly assumes that the man on your team is the leader. Gently correct the assumption and underscore your leader’s accomplishments. For example, “[Name] is our team lead. She heads all our biggest sales efforts.”

    - **Note:** I've seen this happen before - assuming that the male is the leader, or the one that had the idea - and can diminish the recognition of the right people.
      Correcting this on the spot can be done quickly
