- COVID-19 has shifted the work-from-home norms, and possibly for good. According to a PwC survey from June 2020, 55% of executives in the U.S. expect to offer WFH options at least one day a week, even after the pandemic is no longer a threat (compared with 39% before).

- 4 ways to make your workplace a Collaborative Learning environment
- What is ‘active’ and ‘passive’ learning?Active learning is a process where learners are involved in constructing their own understanding of a subject, often through group interactions and applied thinking.
- 1. Embrace decentralized learningCentralized learning flows out from a single point: instructors teach and employees learn. But many businesses are shifting towards a more decentralized approach, making this system obsolete. More employees are working remotely and asynchronously, and they need to break learning into small chunks that fit into their daily work schedule. The first step in decentralizing learning is to shift to online classes that can be completed in micro-sessions throughout the week.

    - **Note:** - with remote work, more and more learning is being done async - having the instructor lead / cohort based learning, while still an option - we need to expand beyond that, and find ways to create async learning opportunities, and create the ability to learn in the flow of work
- But decentralized learning goes farther than that: in a decentralized, Collaborative Learning environment, each team member participates in the learning process. They can identify their learning needs, request courses, give feedback on existing courses, and create courses themselves. We call this a bottom-up approach

    - **Note:** - push vs pull for learning - create an environment that enables learning to happen, and let the people doing the work surface what they need to learn, and then help facilitate and amplify that process
- n traditional learning, executives or a company’s Learning and Development department will make educated guesses about employees’ knowledge gaps and either create or outsource courses to correct those gaps. Courses are expensive to produce and can take months to create. Knowledge flows downward without input from the people receiving it. With a bottom-up approach, employees use a Collaborative Learning platform to make requests for learning opportunities. Everyone can vote on which courses would be most useful, and anyone can offer to teach a course. Courses can be created and updated much more quickly, which helps the company keep their workforce up-to-date on important skills.
- Decentralized learning democratizes knowledge,
- 2. Emphasize self-directed learningNo one knows their own learning needs like your employees do. When you enable self-directed learning, you support your employees’ growth and also maximize the benefits for your company.
- 3. Promote knowledge sharing
- Creating an effective Collaborative Learning environment takes work Creating an effective Collaborative Learning environment requires moving away from instructor-led, top-down learning. And like any sustainable learning ecosystems, it takes effort to put into practice. But research shows that making the shift could lead to more learning in the long run. According to LinkedIn’s 2020 Workplace Learning Report, 67% of Gen Z and 50% of millennials feel motivated to learn in a social and participatory environment. That’s why creating an effective Collaborative Learning environment is so critical to employee engagement and satisfaction.
