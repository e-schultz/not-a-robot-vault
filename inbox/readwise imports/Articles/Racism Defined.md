- The basic beliefs of CRT are:
- Racism is ordinary, the "normal" way that society does business, the "common, everyday" experience of most People of Color in this country.
- Racism serves the interests of both white people in power (the elites) materially and working class white people psychically, and therefore neither group has much incentive to fight it.
- Race and races are social and political constructs, categories that society invents and manipulates when convenient. In reality our differences as human beings are dwarfed by what we have in common and have little or nothing to do with personality, intelligence, and morality.
- Society chooses to ignore this and assigns characteristics to whole groups of people in order to advance the idea of race and the superiority of whiteness.
- The power elite racializes different groups at different times to achieve their economic agenda, continually and repeatedly prioritizing profit over people.
- ​RACISM  DEFINED
- PREJUDICEAn attitude based on limited information, often on stereotypes. Prejudice is usually, but not always, negative. Positive and negative prejudices alike, especially when directed toward oppressed people, are damaging because they deny the individuality of the person. In some cases, the prejudices of oppressed people (“you can’t trust the police”) are necessary for survival. No one is free of prejudice.Examples: Women are emotional. Asians are good at math.
- OPPRESSION
- The systematic subjugation of one social group by a more powerful social group for the social, economic, and political benefit of the more powerful social group.
- Rita Hardiman and Bailey Jackson state that oppression exists when the following 4 conditions are found:the oppressor group has the power to define reality for themselves and others,the target groups take in and internalize the negative messages about them and end up cooperating with the oppressors (thinking and acting like them),genocide, harassment, and discrimination are systematic and institutionalized, so that individuals are not necessary to keep it going, and,members of both the oppressor and target groups are socialized to play their roles as normal and correct.
- Oppression = Power + Prejudice
- SOCIAL and INSTITUTIONAL POWERaccess to resourcesthe ability to influence othersaccess to decision-makers to get what you want donethe ability to define reality for yourself and others
- SYSTEMan interlocking set of parts that together make a wholean established way of doing something, such that things get done that way regularly and are assumed to be the ‘normal’ way things get doneruns by itself; does not require planning or initiative by a person or group
- ADVANTAGEa leg up, a gain, a benefit
- WHITE SUPREMACY
- ​The idea (ideology) that white people and the ideas, thoughts, beliefs, and actions of white people are superior to People of Color and their ideas, thoughts, beliefs, and actions.
- Drawing from critical race theory, the term "white supremacy" also refers to a political or socio-economic system where white people enjoy structural advantage and rights that other racial and ethnic groups do not, both at a collective and an individual level. For more, go to the white supremacy culture page.
- RACERace is a social and political concept, not a scientific one.Even though this is true, race is a powerful political, social, and economic force. Race was and is constructed for social and political purposes, in large part to divide and conquer poor and working white people from poor and working People and Communities of Color..The term ‘white’ was constructed to unite certain European groups living in the U.S. who were fighting each other and at the same time were a numerical minority in comparison to the numbers of African slaves and Native peoples.In order to justify the idea of a white race, every institution in this country was and is used to prove that race exists and to promote the idea that the white race is at the top of the racial hierarchy and all other races are below, with the Black race on the bottom. All institutions were and are used to promote the idea of white supremacy.All European immigrants did not and do not become white at the same time (Irish, Italians, Jews). Becoming white involves giving up parts of your original culture in order to get the advantages and privileges of belonging to the white group.This process continues today.
- RACISMRacism = race prejudice + social and institutional powerRacism = a system of advantage based on raceRacism = a system of oppression based on raceRacism = a white supremacy system
- HOW OPPRESSION OPERATES
- CYCLE  OF OPPRESSION
- In order for oppression (racism in this case) to flourish, we must:
- forget / pretend
- lie
- stop feeling
- lose voice
- make power invisible
- three  expressions  of  racism
- CULTURAL . The ways in which the dominant culture is founded upon and then defines and shapes norms, values, beliefs and standards to advantage white people and oppress people of color
- INSTITUTIONAL . The ways in which the structures, systems, policies, and procedures of institutions in the U.S. are founded upon and then promote, reproduce, and perpetuate advantages for white people and the oppression of People of Color
- PERSONAL . The ways in which we perpetuate and/or assume the idea that white people are inherently better and/or People of Color are inherently inferior on an individual basis.
