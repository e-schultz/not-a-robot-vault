- Two Types of Business Knowledge
  In a business context, knowledge refers to any information an individual or team within your organization can provide that will enable your company to run more efficiently.
  The first type of business knowledge is explicit knowledge—any knowledge that is easy to document and share.
  For example…
  When a marketing team builds a specific sales funnel, they can document various aspects of the process, such as their rationale for using a certain platform, why they developed certain content for a given persona, the compliance documentation they used, etc.
  This explicit information allows all other teams involved (e.g., sales, service, and support) to get a better understanding of the customer’s path to purchase.
  In contrast, the second type of business knowledge is tacit knowledge.
  Tacit knowledge refers to the skills and knowledge learned by experts over years of practice and experience that simply cannot be taught*—let alone put into words.
  (*It is possible to communicate tacit knowledge; we’ll get to that later.)
  An example of tacit knowledge within the scenario described above would how the salesperson who takes over after a lead has been qualified and quickly “works his magic” to seal the deal in record time.
  While the salesman may have gone through the process as if it were second nature to him, it’s nearly impossible to explain exactly what he did to close the sale in such a seemingly effortless way.
- Examples of Knowledge Management
  In practice, knowledge management can look like any of the following:
  Sharable files
  Training materials database
  Internal expert teams
  Role-specific job manuals
  Task management software
- 4 Knowledge Management Best Practices to Implement
- 1. Start with a Culture Shift
- One of the first issues you’re likely to face when spearheading a new (or improving your current) knowledge-management initiative is that some of your employees may not be so open to the change.
  In some cases, you’ll have employees who can’t see why they need to teach other people in the organization how to do their job. In other cases, you’ll have people who don’t understand why they need to learn how to do other people’s jobs. And, of course, you’ll have some employees who fit into both categories.
    - **Note:** Thinking about how this relates to what I'm reading in The Upskilling Imperative, and the advice to "Think Like a Marketer to Drive Learning and Development" 
      Like L&D - Knowledge Management at organizations has it's own hurdles, and things like Notion, Confluence, Jira, Sharepoint, Google Drive, etc -- 
      L&D and KM are closely related - what are the similarities / differences in 
      - Think like a Marketer to Drive KM
      - Better explain how KM and L&D are related
- 2. Identify Knowledge to Focus On
- Creating a knowledge map allows you to visualize the different facets of your organization and break them down into more-specific aspects (and even further, if the case warrants). Within a knowledge map, you can include information like the following:
  What knowledge/information is known
  Who knows or is responsible for knowing a piece of knowledge (as well as who can benefit from knowing it)
  Whether the knowledge is explicit or tacit
