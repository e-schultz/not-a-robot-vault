- Amidst uncertainty, self-mastery is a valued skill
- “Learning and development extends far beyond vertical movement and technical skill development,” says Culture Amp Senior People Scientist Sahra Kaboli-Nejad. “This mindset is a fundamental shift to focusing on the whole employee, rather than simply the technical skills related to their outputs or deliverables.”
- Today's workers, who've spent their professional lives dealing with uncertainty, are taking a holistic approach to their careers and consider self-mastery an essential skill.
- “COVID-19 has really accelerated the shift from ‘remote-accessible' to ‘remote-first' thinking in collaboration design,” says Sprintkick founder and Udemy instructor Evan Kimbrell. “It used to be the case that a large organization was considered ‘progressive' if they could accommodate one remote worker in each functional team. Now, we're seeing a complete inversion of this paradigm.”
  Skills consumption related to this trend varies across industries. Listening skills were a particular focus for the Software & Technology industry, where consumption on Udemy for Business grew 3,201%. The Retail industry made an effort to hone its business etiquette skills by increasing consumption 2,042% compared to the previous year.
