    - **Note:** This has me thinking a bit about / either in the power of habbits, or deep work - the point about needing to structure our leisure time a bit for creative work / hobbies / etc instead of trying to find time. We never find time.

- Work and life are not strictly separated. You may think what you want of Jeff Bezos, but he clearly articulates one of the issues with work-life balance: “That’s a debilitating phrase because it implies there’s a strict trade-off.

- Work-life balance assumes a narrow definition of work. Raising kids and taking care of a loved one are also activities that require effort and can be draining. Work-life balance assumes these are part of life; undertakings people should manage in addition to their official work. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1391607343/15673567))
- Work-life balance is a myth. Perhaps most importantly, achieving a balance means an equilibrium which is a fairy-tale in today’s world. Too many external factors in your life can impact the way work and life are going for you. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1391607343/15673570))
