- Our merry misfit band has experienced a transformation since that fateful initial email now so many years ago. We have published, written, composed, acted, led, and transformed careers. Don’t get me wrong. This book does not unlock the dark secrets of creation and success. These things are still hard work, and this road is still only one of many. This is not THE way. But it is A way. ([Location 43](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0846139FT&location=43))

- guy that wrote software and, later, led other engineers, I found my work schedule left me with less and less time for my passion for acting and the occasional drawing. Had I worked my way out of the club? Had I become an interloper? A poseur? Had the time come to recuse myself? ([Location 52](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0846139FT&location=52))

- I found with increasing frequency that I was recounting to software engineers insights developed in conversations around the fire with my ash-bound brothers. Sometimes resonance was revealed while providing coaching to those struggling with the switch from a monolithic or big-bang software development approach to an iterative one. The Lichtenbergian notion of ABORTIVE ATTEMPTS is not so different from minimal valuable product and incremental delivery of customer value. Both emphasize getting something on the canvas and both recognize that learnings generated from the imperfect make the eventual product better.

- Who’s telling you you can’t? Let me give you a piece of advice right up front. I call it the Lyles Eternal Truth About Actors, and I give this advice to any uncooperative or fearful actor: “There’s no such thing as an actor who can’t, only an actor who won’t.” ([Location 119](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0846139FT&location=119))

- Lichtenberg was prone to procrastination. He failed to launch the first ever hydrogen balloon, and although he always dreamed of writing a novel à la Fielding's Tom Jones, he never finished more than a few pages. He died at the age of 56, after a short illness.[13] “He never finished more than a few pages.” Here, surely, was our patron saint. I teasingly assigned everyone the task of writing the first chapter in a “Tom Jones-like novel,” and we were off. Within a week, The Lichtenbergian Society had a charter, officers, and an agenda for the inaugural meeting. Our motto: Cras melior est. Tomorrow is better. ([Location 236](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0846139FT&location=236))

- For a Lichtenbergian, there is nothing more shameful than getting right to work and doing All The Things. ([Location 270](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0846139FT&location=270))

- Nine Precepts of Lichtenbergianism. 1. Task Avoidance 2. Waste Books 3. Abortive Attempts 4. Gestalt 5. Successive Approximation 6. Ritual 7. Steal From The Best 8. Audience 9. Abandonment ([Location 348](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0846139FT&location=348))
    - **Tags:** #blue
- Each Precept is a loose collection of ideas and principles about the creative process, often overlapping into the others. Lichtenbergianism is incoherent, in the sense that there’s no rigor in its conception or application — you can pick and choose and ignore and embrace each part as it suits your needs. ([Location 351](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0846139FT&location=351))

- It’s one thing to crank out the Abortive Attempts; it’s quite another to assemble them and release them as your band’s CD. Or book of poetry. Or Southern gothic novel.[29] ([Location 378](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0846139FT&location=378))

- But, I hear you ask, how do we transition from “create a lot of bad dreck, but don’t publish it for the love of humankind” to “create successful dreck by putting off publishing it”? ([Location 398](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0846139FT&location=398))

- Here is the secret to successful Task Avoidance: because you are an artist, you have more than one Task to Avoid, each one nagging for your attention. The trick is to play them off against each other, avoiding one by working on another. ([Location 400](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0846139FT&location=400))

- avoiding our actual creative goals in any given year, we end up achieving something else of value. ([Location 409](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0846139FT&location=409))

- This is what John Perry calls “structured procrastination” in his charming and perfect The Art of Procrastination. ([Location 411](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0846139FT&location=411))
    - **Tags:** #blue
- Perry himself quotes a 1930 Robert Benchley column as defining the concept even earlier: “Anyone can do any amount of work, provided it isn’t the work he is supposed to be doing at that moment.” ([Location 413](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0846139FT&location=413))
    - **Tags:** #blue
- The other secret of Task Avoidance is that gestation is a necessary part of the creative process in any model worth the study — and a smart artist uses Task Avoidance to let ideas form fully. ([Location 426](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0846139FT&location=426))
    - **Tags:** #blue
- It is a mistake to think that “creativity” is somehow limited to the actual actions involved in finishing a work. Planning — working out the kinks — developing a framework — sketching, doodling, warming up — daydreaming about possibilities[34] — these are as responsible for the quality of the finished product as are the actual acts of painting or sculpting or composing or writing. ([Location 431](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0846139FT&location=431))
    - **Tags:** #blue
- Another important benefit of Task Avoidance is slack. Slack is that extra bit of rope that allows you to make adjustments in whatever it is you’re doing with that rope — in Lichtenbergianism, slack is extra time, and it is critical to any adaptive system like creativity. ([Location 448](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0846139FT&location=448))

- Just remember that filling every moment with work is not actually being efficient. ([Location 462](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0846139FT&location=462))

- However, my favorite way of making sure that my Task Avoidance is productive (and not just laziness) is the Japanese system known as kanban. ([Location 469](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0846139FT&location=469))

- The first key concept is called “visualizing your workflow,” ([Location 477](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0846139FT&location=477))
    - **Tags:** #blue
- you’re going to procrastinate on most of this. You’re just getting organized about it. ([Location 479](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0846139FT&location=479))
    - **Tags:** #blue
- Note that kanban is not a to-do list. I still have my to-do’s on my phone: mow the lawn, do the laundry, prep the labyrinth. My kanban is for Making the Thing That Is Not and keeping my Task Avoidance on track. ([Location 504](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0846139FT&location=504))
    - **Tags:** #blue
    - **Note:** - I think that this is an important distinction to make, that your todo list is not your Kanban board. I think I’ve made that mistake before, and maybe why I haven’t had as much success with a personal Kanban, .... consider it again
- A brilliant contemporary example of successful structured procrastination is the German artist Anselm Kiefer. Kiefer is known for his often gargantuan paintings ([Location 517](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0846139FT&location=517))

- How does Task Avoidance link to the other Precepts? You can put off a project only so long before you’re no longer in Task Avoidance: you’ve moved into Abandonment. Whether the Abandonment is permanent… well, that becomes a future decision. (You should ask Da Vinci about the difference.) ([Location 528](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0846139FT&location=528))
    - **Tags:** #blue
- Task Avoidance is also linked to Gestalt through Gestation — a good reason to not work on a project is because you’re stepping back to see if you can tell what’s missing. ([Location 539](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0846139FT&location=539))
    - **Tags:** #blue
    - **Note:** - iyow - explain the connection here
- Finally, any strategy you use to manage your Task Avoidance (bullet journals, kanban, scattered piles) should have one major goal in mind: they should leave you with no artistic choice for any given project but to realize that it’s time — that project that has hung about, perhaps for years, is now at the top of your list. It’s time to move it from the Some Day column to the Doing column. It’s time for your first Abortive Attempt. ([Location 545](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0846139FT&location=545))
    - **Tags:** #blue
    - **Note:** Is this what I’ve been doing with Not A Robot - my learning discovery idea - taking teaching and teaching to teach seriously - trying my own thing - my first abortive attempt?
- Practice “structured procrastination” by alternating your projects — avoid working on one project by tinkering with another. Kanban your projects — know what you’re putting off and why. Don’t be afraid to let projects simmer. Learn the difference between Task Avoidance and Abandonment. ([Location 550](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0846139FT&location=550))
- It’s a great idea, one that every creative person needs to consider seriously. Write it all down and come back to it later. Stand-up comics especially use Waste Books, as do poets and other writers, but there’s no reason visual artists or scientists (like Lichtenberg) or code monkeys shouldn’t do so as well. ([Location 583](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0846139FT&location=583))
    - **Tags:** #blue
    - **Note:** I really like this idea of waste books, and also fits in a bit of my ‘make room of what’s left on the editing room floor’ - capture everything, come back to it - edit, but still keep track of the originals, much of that stuff has the potential to be eventually useful,
- Waste Books are wild patches of garden where you throw all the seeds of ideas without any concern about which ones ever “bloom.” ([Location 631](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0846139FT&location=631))
    - **Tags:** #blue
    - **Note:** Waste books are the breeding ground of digital gardens. - what are my waste books? - are my happy books the waste books? I have so many ideas down in those - and ones I mean to revisit, and I know I’ve written down about what I’m working on now in those pages before. What was that line from Russian Doll that I told Ron about - about the sprout growing or some such?
- Sounds like a Waste Book. As much as I would love to be able to sell you the Official Lichtenbergian Brand Waste Book™ — world domination is my goal, after all — it really doesn’t matter what kind of notebook you use. The point is to have something in which you can scribble your ideas without thinking too much about them. Just get it all written into the Waste Book, then later, after the hurly-burly of your day, move those ideas your creative space.

- If after a while a theme called out to him, he would copy it into a larger, second notebook, where he would play with it, trying out variations, harmonizations, improvisations, until he had an idea of how it would work itself out in a piece. And there he would leave it for a while. **Finally he would open a third notebook and use all his Abortive Attempts and Successive Approximations to create the new work before copying it all out to manuscript paper**.

- As silly as all those little bits of dialogue or quirky signs or random musings seem in the moment, if something is funny or moving or profound to you in a moment, it will be again.

    - **Note:** I like to keep track of odd things, from what I photograph on walks - to the memories I associate with them, at times it might be a word that catches my eye at that moment. Looking back through my journals, photos, things - things pop out, and the context might have a new lense.

- The whole point of writing abortive attempts or Bach’s J.J. or Willard’s wasted efforts at the top of your page is to give yourself permission to fail.[57] You disarm the Critic in your head by telling him ahead of time — “this piece, this drawing, this poem, is going to be crap. I am deliberately going to put down whatever comes into my head or my fingers and there’s nothing you can do to stop me.” ([Location 836](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0846139FT&location=836))

    - **Note:** I find that with certain note taking apps - my head goes into ‘final state sooner’, outliners, obsidian, roam let that very free flowing thought start, then its the pulling it together and curation. Or in my note books - writing to get it out, and permission to throw it away, the explicit first draft, the project named ‘xyz PoC’ —- it is kind of weird how well it works
- So don’t try to make it “good.” Just keep moving forward, adding new pieces, loops, backtracks. Scratch stuff out. Paint stuff over. Take stuff apart. You’ll know when it’s time to make it “good,” and it’s better if you don’t try to force the issue until that time, because if you do, you’ll simply find yourself at another dead end.

- Here’s another pro tip: One of the biggest mistakes an artist makes is what we call the King of Hearts[62] Fallacy: “Begin at the beginning, and go on until you come to the end: then stop.” We have this image that an artist sits down to write her novel or compose his sonata or write their poem — and she just launches right into it and works straight through until she’s through. Then she writes The End and we all live happily ever after. ([Location 925](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0846139FT&location=925))

- One of the key points about Successive Approximation is made by the fable related in Art & Fear[82] of the ceramics teacher who divided his class, telling one half that their final grade will depend only on the quantity of their work, i.e., 50 pounds of pots will get them an A; and the other half that their grade will depend on the quality of one single pot they produce. At the end of the semester, of course, it was the students who made more pots who ended up with the better work.

- Over the years in my various roles as media specialist, artistic director, and educational administrator, I always had to deal with getting things done in an orderly and timely fashion. I had to adhere to (and often develop) processes for these jobs, and in the process[84] I realized a certain truth: “It takes three cycles to get any new process right.” In other words, you have to start and end a process at least twice before you can say you have a grip on it. The corollary to the Lyles Theorem of Process Development is, “…if you don’t change the process, that is.” ([Location 1257](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0846139FT&location=1257))

- In its various incarnations, the message is simple: we take from those who have come before and use their gift to us to create our own Thing That Is Not. Merely borrowing what came before, however, is not enough; the new Thing may be good, but it cannot be great unless we have taken it completely as our own and left nothing behind.

- Reverse engineer their work — figure out how they did it. Use the same strategies they used, but to create your work.

- Precept 8: Audience It is almost impossible to write anything good without imagining someone, or a certain group of people, whom one is addressing.

- Austin Kleon, author of Steal Like an Artist, said in a tweet one day (and I’m paraphrasing from memory): Imagine yourself appearing before an adoring crowd of hundreds, even thousands of fans. Do you imagine that every single one of them really, truly cares about your work? No, of course not. Maybe half a dozen do. Those people are your Audience.[117] I would add: The rest of them are The Crowd. Don’t create for The Crowd. The Crowd has no taste.

- Brian Eno, when he was an art student, began to look askance at the way artistic giants like Picasso and Michelangelo were being presented as solitary men of genius, towering alone over their time and place. He, too, saw that they were part of the cool kids club, and he devised a term for that: scenius. He defined scenius as “the intelligence and the intuition of a whole cultural scene. It is the communal form of the concept of the genius.”[118] It is Those People Right Here. As blogger Kevin Kelley puts it, a scenius gives its members “mutual appreciation, rapid exchange of tools and techniques, network effects of success, and local tolerance for the novelties.” When you’re surrounded by people inspired by the same things as you, you all benefit from the flow.
