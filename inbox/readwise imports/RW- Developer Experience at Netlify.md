- Combining teaching and development sounded like a nice way to progress beyond the coding or engineering management work I was doing at the time.
  To my surprise, as soon as I started speaking, writing, and engaging in open source, people began downplaying the role in our industry. There seemed to be a false dichotomy that you were either a communicator or an engineer, often put forth by folks with a fraction of my own engineering experience. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1383204298/15456095))
    - **Note:** Think we don't provide enough support on helping engineers become better communicators
- Here were some of the issues I noted contributing to FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt) about Developer Advocates:
  A lack of understanding of how communication plays a part in adopting and using a technology
  Companies not properly empowering these groups
  These groups, at times, moving too far away from engineering disciplines, which can give them a lack of empathy for the folks they‚Äôve set out to engage with and represent
  This last one is painful but I‚Äôll just say it: I didn‚Äôt see Developer Advocacy downplayed until underrepresented people started participating, and I believe unconscious bias played a part in why it went from ‚Äúpeak technical‚Äù to ‚Äúnon-technical‚Äù ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1383204298/15456102))
    - **Note:** [[developer advocacy FUD]]
- What we shifted to was truly a hybrid advocacy and engineering group designed to engage and empower users at every step of their journey. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1383204298/15456114))
    - **Note:** [[hybrid advocacy and engineering]] instead of Treating them as two distinct things
- Our department is dedicated to making sure that developers and stakeholders can have a wonderful workflow with our platform. This is core to other functions at the company as well, such as Product and Engineering- the idea of making developers feel like everything is at their fingertips. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1383204298/15456129))
    - **Note:** This feeling of everything is at thier fingertips - can apply for public users, but also internal teams as well
- Team structure
  Much like a Boys II Men harmony, the Developer Experience organization at Netlify consists of 3 parts. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1383204298/15456132))
- Developer Experience Engineering
  Developer Experience Engineering is a hybrid role that is an intersection between more traditional advocacy of engaging in communities, writing posts, and doing open source work with engineering work. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1383204298/15456135))
    - **Note:** [[developer experience]]
- Recently we built a learning platform called Jamstack Explorers, which was built with Next.js, Sanity.io, Cloudinary, and serverless functions. Not only was the video content developed by the team, but also every part of the functionality, and there‚Äôs more to come! This project is open source; you can check the repo out here. We can blame Jason Lengstorf for the space-themed musical interlude on the readme. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1383204298/15456147))
    - **Note:** I've been curious about how different places approach [[learning platforms]]]
- Team members also go on product engineering rotations. Typically, they consist of the engineer leaving advocacy duties altogether and joining the Product Engineering team for a set amount of time. During this time, their reporting structure changes- aside from check-ins, they no longer report to me, they report to an engineering manager in Product. I believe this helps with a few things:
  Since Netlify‚Äôs app is built with Netlify, they get a deep understanding of the system both from the point of view of building it, but also dogfooding it.
  Empathy for the complexity of Netlify at scale as well as what work goes into powering the system
  Building relationships with folks on the Product team for when we have feedback for how our systems work ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1383204298/15456158))
    - **Note:** Having the engineers go on rotation on engineering teams helps them better understand what's going on.
      They can join different teams - maybe could people from other teams temporary join this one?
- As is typical of Developer Advocacy, we also write articles, create open source repos, and speak to folks- we try to make the materials we wish we had when first understanding the thing. We want everyone to feel like they have all the tools at their fingertips to focus on what is meaningful to them, with everything else abstracted away. We also let Cassidy tweet sometimes which has its benefits and pitfalls. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1383204298/15456169))
    - **Note:** How much can this apply to [[internal developer experience]]
- Integrations Engineering
  Following in the same vein of thinking through the experience of developers is the Integrations Engineering team. This team does 100% engineering work, no advocacy. They are in charge of packages and build plugins like Next on Netlify- a tool that provides special per-framework support that extends Netlify‚Äôs platform to work with special features of the given frameworks. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1383204298/15456182))
    - **Note:** Hrmm - we have some integration needs - how can this fit in with enablement / success?
- Documentation
  This is new! As of a month ago, the Documentation team at Netlify has moved under Developer Experience and we couldn‚Äôt be more thrilled! Docs can have a profound impact on developer ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1383204298/15456192))
    - **Note:** Trying to make and keep documentation is updated is a large job - with it's own set of skills.
- This team consists of Rachael Stavchansky focusing on workflow, Jacklyn Carroll, focusing on runtime and integrated apps, and Kristen Lavavej, focusing on something exciting we can‚Äôt quite talk about yet ü§´ ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1383204298/15456194))
- Team OKRs
  Because Developer Experience is a hybrid advocacy and engineering, our Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) are:
  Qualified Signups
  Active Developers (and the depth of use of the platform)
  Engineering throughput: PRs merged, how many days an issue is open, and how many issues closed ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1383204298/15456196))
    - **Note:** I've never been the best at [[OKRs]] buy this is a good start
- In terms of career advancement, it doesn‚Äôt have as much to do with these OKRs as it does this formula: to get to Senior, you try to be the best YOU you can be ‚Äì work to be at the height of your skillset. To get to Staff, you try to make systems and help others to be successful at the things you know well. To get to Principal, you help others to be successful where they are. I plan to open source all of our department‚Äôs career ladders in the coming year. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1383204298/15456205))
    - **Note:** Career growth within the structure
