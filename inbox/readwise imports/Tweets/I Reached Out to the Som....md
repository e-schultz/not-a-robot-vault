### Highlights first exported February 16, 2021 at 5:15 PM

- I reached out to the someone senior at a prior tech job, and I shared my ADHD diagnosis with them. I left that job after a lot of things went wrong for me. I felt like I needed to clear the air, and also that someone else might fall into the pit I did.
  1/17
    - **Note:** Save [[neurodiverse twitter]] [[Neurodiverse Tech]] [[ADHD at work]]
- We did some cool stuff, but there were structural problems there for me, that really made everything just worse than it normally was. In part because I was the only remote employee and they didn't understand how much structure I needed. 
  I didn't understand.
  2/17
- I don't owe that company anything, but I hoped I could make them understand at least how I struggled, and why. It doesn't change anything for me, but maybe just maybe it might change things for someone else. No one actively wanted me to fail, but I was seen through a lens.
  3/17
- Puzzlement, disappointment. They knew I was smart. I passed the interview including an on my feet tech interview. But I struggled so hard with some stuff. A lot was high level designs, and they wanted to give people freedom to just do it. 
  4/17
- I had to switch to WFH for reasons. Loss of body doubling/peer coding, large amorphous tasks, and no real deadlines absolutely took a toll. People noticed things were not getting done. Feedback loops were non-existent. Mistakes were made. 
  5/17
- I would implement what I thought JIRA ticket said, only to have missed key details. When I realized this was happening (again), I transitioned to my second mode. Slow deliberate, focus on the details, triple check. My boss commented my velocity was down.
  6/17
- RSD kicked my ass. I was making all this effort and I was either too fast and having to redo the work, or too slow (and some mistakes still being made). I switched back to fast mode, and I totally implemented a feature incorrectly.
  7/17
- I got a meeting with HR sent out at 5pm Friday night, when I was supposed to pop into the office for a fortnightly visit. It just said "discussion" or similar. I would not sleep that weekend, and RSD consumed me, almost constant rumination drove me.
  8/17
- I went down to Melbourne (I'd told my SO I might be fired), and I cleaned off my work laptop. The meeting was at 9am. They asked me what was wrong, and I broke down and sobbed for close to 20 mins. I couldn't just say "I can't seem to do my job". I was put on a PIP.
  9/17
- A PIP is short for a Performance Improvement Plan. I was underperforming, making mistakes. I was a senior dev in name only, and all my work had to be regularly vetted and progress checked by two other senior devs. I felt a lot of shame. I retreated.
  10/17
- I stopped offering my opinion in technical discussions. Finally someone (the acting technical architect) saw fit to give me a very specific task. Implementing a very specific network protocol to talk to printers. I did well at this... It was my wheelhouse.
  11/17
- It had key ingredients. Building bridges between systems, very specific details of the protocol. Immediate reward (see that piece of paper, or that printer initiating self-test? I did that). Magic glue has always excited me. Making things work! 
  12/17
- I got it working across 95% of printer models. I drilled down, wrote reports. Then I handed it off. I was put back onto the type of work I was doing before when I struggled. The reward for doing well was to put me back in the situation I struggled in. 
  13/17
- It wasn't sustainable. I contacted an old employer, and managed to get a foot in the door doing automation work (something I excel at because I hate repetitive tasks), and I resigned. In my exit interview I struggled to articulate myself. 
  14/17
- I left with a card filled with mostly vanilla "good luck" messages. A few messages were from junior devs thanking me for teaching them things (I was always better at this than doing). I always stopped to help where I could. Helping was dopamine.
  15/17
- The person I reached out to said they wanted to understand how they could have helped me better, knowing what I know now. They want me to point them to resources and information about ADHD. I'd like to believe they are genuine.
  16/17
- I feel like maybe I will do something - at least point them at some stuff, offer some feedback. I wouldn't be doing it for them, and I'd want to make that clear. 
  I'd be doing it for the next person (maybe they are already there now).
