- Tech leadership, managers, team leads really need to get this.
  Especially Prioritize the Most Vulnerable.
  And really need to understand that because something isn't a problem for you, or you haven't seen it 
  - doesn't mean it's not a problem. https://t.co/WfjCi0tQLW ([View Highlight](https://twitter.com/evan_just_evan/status/1364902542124146689))
- People also need to stop expecting a quick fix or easy win.
  This requires education and effort beyond the office.
  It requires people to go out and educate themselves.
  Stop expecting to be taught via a one hour training session at work once in awhile. ([View Highlight](https://twitter.com/evan_just_evan/status/1364902543550251009))
- But it's like a DEI training happens and white people feel good about attending.
  But then actually do the work after? ([View Highlight](https://twitter.com/evan_just_evan/status/1364902544481390592))
- It's hard work - and it's been a few years since I've started.
  one of the most important things for me has been education.
  Or more accurately feels like a re-education of what my understanding of what racism is. ([View Highlight](https://twitter.com/evan_just_evan/status/1364905219100917765))
- So much of my own education and understanding of racism was basically focused on:
  - interpersonal actions between people, not a system
  - obvious overt racism like Nazi's and the KKK 
  - Generally framed more as an American and not us (Canadian) problem ([View Highlight](https://twitter.com/evan_just_evan/status/1364905220531232770))
- Which has produced generations of white people, that think they are liberal / progressive and in no way racist, and fail to see the racism in the systems around them and how they are benefiting from it. ([View Highlight](https://twitter.com/evan_just_evan/status/1364905221386874882))
- And then the "please teach me" mindset.
  Go read a fucking book. ([View Highlight](https://twitter.com/evan_just_evan/status/1364905222192119809))
- I've been in a similar position 
  - queer, ND (but not super open about I), at a company for a long time 
  - feeling like things were pretty good for me as a queer person 
  And that leading to some comfort. ([View Highlight](https://twitter.com/evan_just_evan/status/1364917205511655429))
- I also had a few assumptions that everyone:
  - had the same access to leadership and support that I had 
  - knew that they had it 
  - Felt comfortable reaching out
  - Felt safe
  - Felt like they would be believed and taken seriously ([View Highlight](https://twitter.com/evan_just_evan/status/1364917206581084171))
- Like I reached out to the CEO and HR when I was having PTSD flash back melt down while walking to work and they were there for me.
  Everyone knows how to do that, right? 
  Are we sure about that? ([View Highlight](https://twitter.com/evan_just_evan/status/1364917207621328900))
- DEI has been something that I've cared about for awhile, but at the same time along time of that was at a very shallow level.
  Once I became a manager, and started to really listen to people and what they were dealing with - I was like oooh. ([View Highlight](https://twitter.com/evan_just_evan/status/1364917208489611264))
- It's so easy to get caught up in the cultures of busy, and not bring our heads up to look beyond our next task on our plate.
  And symptoms of this issue show up in many places, but then companies think that people just need to work harder. ([View Highlight](https://twitter.com/evan_just_evan/status/1364917209416482820))
- They track the wrong metrics, attribute "performance concerns" to the wrong things.
  Give feedback like speak Io more - without considering why someone may not be speaking up. ([View Highlight](https://twitter.com/evan_just_evan/status/1364917210267983872))
- Complicating things - is to talk about these, we need to talk about 
  - racism 
  - sexism 
  - homophobia / transphobia 
  - abelism 
  But talking about these often get silenced as "we don't talk politics at work" ([View Highlight](https://twitter.com/evan_just_evan/status/1364917211232677892))
- Sorry that my life, and other marginalized / under represented coworkers and the challenges they face daily are "political issues" for you.
  Not sorry, I'm Canadian - sorry ðŸ’… ([View Highlight](https://twitter.com/evan_just_evan/status/1364917212172210178))
