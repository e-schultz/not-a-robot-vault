### Highlights first exported February 9, 2021 at 7:45 AM

- The more I learn about #ADHD and #Autism - the more it seems like many aspects the myself are explained by autism.
  I know symptoms can overlap, and it's not uncommon for people to be both.
  But as my understanding deepens beyond what we see in pop culture, the more I'm..... Oh
    - **Note:** Save
- I've talked with my therapist about this a few times, and have gotten a "probably, but seems like you have learned to manage / adapt well and not sure if getting a diagnosis is worth the effort"
  As getting a Dx as an adult isn't always easy.
- And this isn't some 
  "oh, lol I can relate to characters like Sheldon and Abed, I'm quirky and everyone is a little bit autistic"
  But been alot of reflection, how I am now, looking back at my childhood, etc.
- When a new piece of information clicks with me - it triggers this 
  ðŸ”Ž "re-evaluate my life through this new lense"
  At times it's minor, other times it's intense - like getting a high def replay of my life.
- The amount of details, how vividly I remember them - like it's almost a flash back but not quite, but I can see it - then rooms, the people, how the light filtered in through a window.
  It can be beautiful but exhausting at the same time.
- I remember there would be times I'd try and give for a walk, or trying to walking to work - and boom, replay of my life with deep analysis.
  Like a years worth of therapy crammed into 30 minutes, then I'd need to give home and sleep because it mentally exhausted me.
- Part of me is reluctant to self Dx, although the information, tools and listening to others expiernces are being a big help, and have been a benefit to me.
- As things click into place, it also makes it easier to be a little bit kinder, forgiving and gentler on myself.
  So many things that I've felt, or been made to feel area broken and wrong with me - are not broken or wrong.
  Just different.
- It comes with its challenges, and some days can be a real struggle.
  But, it can also be beautiful - and a way of viewing the world that I wouldn't want to change, even if given the option.
