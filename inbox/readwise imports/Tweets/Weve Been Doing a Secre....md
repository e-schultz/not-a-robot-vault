- We've been doing a secret hiring experiment.
  and I think it's working ;)
  THREAD ⬇️
    - **Note:** Save
- I was dissatisfied with traditional hiring. You get tons of CVs, can't possibly interview everyone so choose some with prestigious employers/education and relevant keywords.
- In so doing, your biases kick in and you exclude people who had a rough start to life or are different from you. Then you have 30 min chats, which tells you who's good at 30 min chats.
- Unless the job is '30 min chatting' (sign me up!), this is a terrible predictor of performance. And you end up with a team of people who look much like you and are nice to chat to.
- SCREW THAT.
- So we started to turn the process on its head.
  Now we don't look at anyone's CV until LATE in the process. Instead, we put tons of info in the job ad and answer questions by updating it so everyone's on a level playing field.
- The ad links to screening questions which we separate from names and blind double mark. This surfaces candidates who really know their stuff. And surprise surprise, it's NOT the usual suspects.
  We did this as an experiment, but it's worked so well that we're making it permanent.

  We're recruiting engineers, product designers, and marketers :)
- Post-script: LOL, now I am getting tons of inbound from recruiters saying "Great post on hiring, what a great innovation! Anyway I recruit for that role, can I send you some CVs?"
