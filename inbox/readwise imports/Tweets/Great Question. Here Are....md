- Great question. Here are some questions to ask when interviewing to weed out bad manager culture. Ask multiple people; compare their answers.
  üç∏How did you become a manager? Do you enjoy it? (Never work for someone who was pressed into management, or doesn't seem happy.) https://t.co/Py5cEWLHMP ([View Highlight](https://twitter.com/mipsytipsy/status/1356977806899515394))
    - **Note:** Save interviewing up for manager culture
- üç∏ What do you like about it? (Red flags include, "I was tired of being out of the loop and left out of decision-making process.")
  üç∏ Is management a promotion, or a lateral move? What kind of training do you offer managers, and what are they evaluated on? ([View Highlight](https://twitter.com/mipsytipsy/status/1356978735799443456))
- üç∏ Do you have a job ladder for individual contributors (ICs)? Can I see it? Do the IC levels track management levels all the way, or top out at some point? 
  üç∏ Are levels public, or private? What is the distribution of engineers across levels, roughly? (Look for... (cont'd) ‚û°Ô∏è) ([View Highlight](https://twitter.com/mipsytipsy/status/1356979707586048001))
- (Look for how high the IC track goes, ask how many of those exist. Distribution should be scant at the upper bound. Do the written level descriptions seem reasonable and appealing to you?)
  üç∏ Do they have any junior and intermediate engineers? If not, why the fuck not? *Ask.* ([View Highlight](https://twitter.com/mipsytipsy/status/1356981029290958860))
- üç∏ How often do they have 1x1s? Skip levels?
  üç∏ Ask the engineers, "does your manager care about you? Has working here moved your career forward? How so? ü§î and, "have you ever been surprised by something in your review from your manager?" (You should *never* be surprised.) ([View Highlight](https://twitter.com/mipsytipsy/status/1356982662678732800))
- üç∏ Most of all, can you get them to tell you "no" on a thing you want? Or are they squirmy, evasive, or hedging?
  If they can look you straight and say "no, and here's why", you can probably trust them to be straight with you, in good times and hard. ([View Highlight](https://twitter.com/mipsytipsy/status/1356986094579929088))
- üç∏ Another good question, this one's a classic: "what is the process by which someone ends up working on a particular project?" How does work get decided and allocated, in other words? (Bad signs: flustered/unclear, you have no say, no product/design process, jira tasks) ([View Highlight](https://twitter.com/mipsytipsy/status/1356987157118771202))
- üç∏ Depending on your level and career goals, you can ask questions to ascertain if the right gap exists for you to fit and reach your goals. Don't join a team where five other people are already eyeing the role you want, etc.

- That's all I've got off the top of my head. Maybe @GergelyOrosz or @JillWohlner will have more questions on "what to ask when interviewing, to suss out a healthy management culture"? ü§î ([View Highlight](https://twitter.com/mipsytipsy/status/1356988826380431362))
