- I get why so many folks are doing half hour 1:1's and also no wonder why people find it so hard to build rapport and relationships in half-ass remote. It's so compressed there's only time for statuses and harried context exchange so feelings go in the background to fester and rot
    - **Note:** Save [[neurodiverse tech]] [[neurodiverse twitter]] and [[ADHD at work]]
- looking at replies I should add: I have 1:1's with people all over the company and at every level, I'm not just talking about manager 1:1's. If that's your only 1:1 I encourage branching out and having them with more folks around the business.
