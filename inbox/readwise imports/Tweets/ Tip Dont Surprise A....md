- ðŸ’¡ Tip: Don't surprise a first time manager with 20+ direct reports 
  It didn't go well.
  Well, it went well in some ways.
  But I also burnt out fast, ended up needing to take over a month off of work for mental health. https://t.co/KrvVloT8EG
    - **Note:** Save don't surprise first time managers
- This was compounded by a difficult time in my personal life (difficult separation) - I had zero emotional buffer on most days, let alone dealing with a bad home situation, lawyers, etc.
- Once I started to return to work - it was a modified / part time schedule, and wasn't a manager for awhile after that.
  It took months till fully bounce back.
- Round two of being a manager 
  - was asked if I wanted to / was ready it again 
  - was a small number of people 
  - my manager put alot of thought with matching people up 
  Went much better that time.
