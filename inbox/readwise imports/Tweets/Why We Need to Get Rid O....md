- Why we need to get rid of functioning labels (a thread)
    - **Note:** Save autism and functioning labels - tend to be Abelist
- Functioning labels (“high-functioning/Aspergers”, “low-functioning/severe”) are often used to determine which autistic person gets what kinds of services and supports.
- The problem with using functioning labels is that they’re not only inaccurate, they’re ableist as well.
- Autistic people have a wide range of abilities that often don’t mesh well enough to be categorized into one label.
- For example, one person may be a genius at math and have a P.H. D, but can’t tie their shoes.
- Another person may be nonspeaking, but can maintain a clean home on their own.
- And sometimes our abilities to do daily tasks fluctuate depending on our energy and stress levels. Our abilities to do these tasks based on these levels are known as executive functioning levels.
- Home and community based services and supports need to be tailored to each autistic person based on each skill they can do, not on archaic terms like “high-functioning” and “low-functioning”.
