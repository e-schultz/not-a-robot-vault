- Absolutely agree.
  We are specifically training in ICU for "teaming" (@AmyCEdmondson) and "team resilience" ie the ability to adapt and respond to changing conditions. https://t.co/CoaoKEY5PR
    - **Note:** Save

  To understand how things should go and might go.
  To create space for shared problem solving.
  To actively ask for what we need from each other.
