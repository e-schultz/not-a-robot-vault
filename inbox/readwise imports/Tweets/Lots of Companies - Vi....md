- Lots of companies 
  - view it as an extra few meetings that you can add ontop of your current workload.
  - Assume because you are technically strong, that translates into leadership skills 
  - Think that team cohesion just happens https://t.co/xF1GJeBbMR
    - **Note:** Save [[voluntold manager]] - the first time I became a manager at Rangle
- Lots of companies also don't offer growth paths past senior.
  Resulting in going into management as the only growth option, instead of an option.
- Most managers I know - myself included, got voluntold that they are a manager now.
  Often with minimal / no training before hand.
  if training doe happen - tends to be months / years later.
  Unless the person does alot of self education on how to be a manager.
- I actively avoided becoming a manager for a few years, and turned down the offer because it felt like I was still growing in other areas.
  Once I got voluntold that i'm a manager - it was a bit of surprise, and here's 25 some direct reports.
- I quickly realized being an IC wasn't going to work.
  I remember going to all of the stakeholders / my manager / client partner / etc and explaining that I won't have time to code anymore.
- Thankfully everyone at the company understood, but there was also some challenges with client optics - but meh.
  I remember after a week or two of having no idea what I was doing, finally asking my manager:
  - So - what do I need to do, and how does thus impact my day to day
- I got a bit of a 
  - here's what I should have been doing more often with you 
  - Read this book - and was handed a copy of Radical Candor
  Thankfully alot of what I had been doing before involved alot of the related / transferable skills, but I still felt clueless
- Even a few year's later - I enjoy being a manager.
  When I was looking for a new job after getting hit by COVID19 layoffs - looked for an engineering manager role.
  I still feel like I have no idea what I'm doing - not sure if the Imposter syndrome will ever go away.
- On the upside - I don't have the expectation to be writing code myself.
  Nearly a year - and haven't had my name attached to see ticket yet.
- Not sure if I'll stay an engineering manager / on the manager track or look at other options someday.
  But - don't have a strong interest in being hands on writing code daily either.
