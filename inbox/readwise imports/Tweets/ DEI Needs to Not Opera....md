- üíØ DEI needs to not operate in a silo
  It shouldn't be filed under HR 
  It shouldn't be reduced down to corporate training sessions that happen once or twice a year, and most forget about after. https://t.co/NmUQcJsl6K ([View Highlight](https://twitter.com/evan_just_evan/status/1365262868871057415))

- I think that there's an overlap with everything from 
  - recruitment, outreach, talent brand, community engagement 
  - sales / marketing 
  - on boarding
  - training / education / career growth 
  - how we manage, and train managers ([View Highlight](https://twitter.com/evan_just_evan/status/1365265723732410369))
- It needs to be a core consideration in "how do we work as an organization"
  Not a feel-good add on that you do after the "real" work is done.
  How to actually make this happen? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è ([View Highlight](https://twitter.com/evan_just_evan/status/1365265724948815875))
- People also need to be willing to put in the effort and work to learn, and educate themselves.
  If the only DEI education they are getting is during that once in a blue moon workshop - thats not enough. ([View Highlight](https://twitter.com/evan_just_evan/status/1365268507139670019))
- I also think that there needs to be a place for white people to talk things out, share what they are learning and able to talk about it.
  When white people get "uncomfortable" - and don't want to talk about it, that's a quick way to shut down DEI efforts. ([View Highlight](https://twitter.com/evan_just_evan/status/1365268508674826240))
- When people are raising issues / concerns / problems about the efforts around DEI - consider the power and privilege of the person complaining.
  This is a complex topic - and groups of people can be upset or harmed by the same thing but for different reasons. ([View Highlight](https://twitter.com/evan_just_evan/status/1365268509530460160))
- White cis het people feeling uncomfortable.
  is not the same as 
  harm caused to marginalized people. ([View Highlight](https://twitter.com/evan_just_evan/status/1365268510423867392))
