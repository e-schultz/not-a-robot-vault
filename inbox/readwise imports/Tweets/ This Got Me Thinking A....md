- 💡 This got me thinking about work 
  - How many times have I not done something because it wasn't explicitly stated?
  Like we all talked about the thing, agreed to it, seems like everyone is on board.
  without that explicit - "now go do that thing", sometimes I don't. https://t.co/hYcG2AZyGI ([View Highlight](https://twitter.com/evan_just_evan/status/1362617453487022082))
    - **Note:** Save vampire rules at work
- Even if there's a great deal of flexibility in the how we go about it, still need that explicit signal.
  The signal can be a:
  - go do it
  Or
  - you have my support to go do it 
  This makes a few work things make more sense 🧐 ([View Highlight](https://twitter.com/evan_just_evan/status/1362617454854291457))
