- Let's talk about how white tech bros use their platforms to perpetuate harm and then distance themselves from it. Here's the basic formula: ([View Highlight](https://twitter.com/CallMeWuz/status/1366509054647021568)) ^8d14eb
    - **Note:** Save tech twitter unfuckdei tech bro perpetuate harm
- 1. Say/do something harmful.
  This usually is something rooted in vague racism, biases, and stereotypes or in the effects of those things: not having a diverse network, listening only to people who sound like you, and ignoring the voices you disagree with.

- 2. Get called out
  This is almost always done by a marginalized individual and usually falls on Black women, who most definitely do not have time for this shit. But they do it anyway, because all too often no one else is going to show up. ([View Highlight](https://twitter.com/CallMeWuz/status/1366509057595609099))
- 3. Defend and deflect
  "I'm not the problem!"
  "I'm from another country!"
  "I'm trying to help!"
  "That wasn't the intent!"
  The thing about these is that it immediately signals an intent to not listen and grow. People don't like to sit in their discomfort, but that's how you grow. ([View Highlight](https://twitter.com/CallMeWuz/status/1366509058723840000))
- 4. Call in your friends
  For a lot of mediocre white dudes (MWD) with large followings, this means calling in other MWD with large followings and all the MWD that follow them. Suddenly it is a very one-sided argument. The original caller-outer is overwhelmed. ([View Highlight](https://twitter.com/CallMeWuz/status/1366509059806007299))
- 5. Get called out more, double down more
  Repeat steps 2 and 3 until discomfort has reached it's peak. This usually involves others coming in and posting examples of other problematic things MWD has done and harm they have caused. ([View Highlight](https://twitter.com/CallMeWuz/status/1366509060921716739))
- 6. Delete, block, and deflect
  Once discomfort has grown, the MWD usually deletes the tweets in question, leaving a one-sided, unparsable conversation. They then block the people calling them out (usually Black women, remember), and deflect w/ banal tweets out of thread. ([View Highlight](https://twitter.com/CallMeWuz/status/1366509062402244610))
- 7. Perpetuate harm and repeat
  Since the MWD has now blocked everyone from whom they can learn, they continue to perpetuate harm and never learn. Their friends and followers often continue to harass the folks that called them out and they get to move on, unharmed and unperturbed. ([View Highlight](https://twitter.com/CallMeWuz/status/1366509063564099591))
- This happens all the time. You can watch it happen in real time and notice the signals as the get close to the inevitable end. We need to do better as an industry. We need to learn from our mistakes and own up to them and we need to listen to Black women. ([View Highlight](https://twitter.com/CallMeWuz/status/1366509064822341634))
- Take a look at who you are following. How many look like you? What are you gonna do about it? Once you've figured that out, continue to prune and weed out your following list. Curate a feed that promotes voices that are different from yours. Listen when they tell you shit. ([View Highlight](https://twitter.com/CallMeWuz/status/1366509065946431490))
