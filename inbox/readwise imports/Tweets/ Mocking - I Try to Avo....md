- ðŸ¥· Mocking - I try to avoid it
  I use mocks only when:
  * speed of test suite is a problem
  * using external 3rd party services (e.g. 3rd party HTTP APIs)
  ðŸ§µðŸ‘‡ Short thread about my guidelines for mocking
  #Python #pytest #SoftwareTesting
- ðŸ¥·Speed is a problem:
  I want my test suite to be fast. I want to run it frequently.
  For example, I had test suite using a real DynamoDB table. It took around 1.5min to run.
  Mock DynamoDB with moto -> 5s to run.
  Now I can run it all the time.
- ðŸ¥· External HTTP API:
  I have integration with the ERP system via the REST API. On every test run, a new product is added to ERP.
  I don't want to actually add a product to ERP - I'll need to delete it somehow.
  I mock API - no need to handle anything in ERP inside my test suite.
- ðŸ¥· By all means, I avoid mocking inside a single package
  For example, I have a blog package.
  I don't mock methods/classes implemented inside the blog package when testing any behavior inside the blog package.
