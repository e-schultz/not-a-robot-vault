- This reminds me alot about how the feedback we tend to get at work can also be very conflicting at times.
  Even something like - "you should really speak up more" can have some issues. https://t.co/M3MAU3DSck
    - **Note:** Save work feedback and being neurodiverse
- Wrote a bit about it before:

- When it's made as a comment - can get internalized very strongly.
  If it's given as formal feedback at work - ðŸ˜“
  Even positive feedback - if vague, is useless at best.
  Potentially harmful as well 
  - breaks down trust 
  - can be manipulative 
  - could focus on the wrong thing
- ðŸ’© And avoid the shit sandwich.
  Trying to balance out positive / negative feedback into some arbitrary balance sucks.
  Especially if you use an insincere compliment for the bread of the shit sandwich.
  You just have a pile of ðŸ’© at that point.
