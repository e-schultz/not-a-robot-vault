### Highlights first exported February 9, 2021 at 7:45 AM

- - being able to highlight in real time 
  - can add comments 
  - add screen shots 
  - I can go back and edit the transcript after, and it keeps in sync with the audio recording

- At times the transcript accuracy is a bit off, but if I edit to clean it up - it's like scrubbing my thoughts.
  The combination of 
  - reading 
  - listening 
  - then editing and correcting 
  Helps alot to process / understand and remember.
- I'll also take lots of screen shots and add them - good visual cues, and I find more useful than a video recording for me.
  Being able to comment and add links to things like 
  - slack threads 
  - jira tickets 
  - google docs 
  - blogs / articles 
  - my other notes
- At times during a meeting I'll remember "oh yeah that thing" - quickly find a link to it, and add it to the transcript.
  It starts to build into a densely linked personal knowledge management system / map.
- This combined with my other note taking methods - helps me find / surface information, and within the context that makes sense to me.
  Bookmarks are useless for me, as they tend to exist without context.
- Having information and notes get (somewhat) naturally surfaced where I expect to find it vs needing to go searching for it all the time = one of the best things I started to do for myself in 2020.
- The nature of remote work, especially in tech 
  - information is stored /everywhere/ in so many different apps and tools.
  Off the top of my head, some of the things I need to check regularly
- - multiple jira boards 
  - multiple trello boards 
  - notion 
  - Confluence 
  - namely 
  - office vibe 
  - more Slack than I care for 
  - google drive 
  - email 
  - figma 
  - Miro 
  and I'm probably missing a few
- Trying to fit all of that into one tool often fails.
  Trying to organize it in a way that makes sense for everyone is also difficult.
  Collaborative notes / knowledge management / etc is important.
  But dont undervalue the importance of building your own system
- Mine makes sense to me - but would overwhelm others.
  I use it as my working memory pretty much - that links to other systems.
  It's also the working draft of my information dumps - that I eventually clean up, and get into a shareable form for others.
