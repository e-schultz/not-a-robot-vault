- Hyperfocus and hyperfixations are slightly different things, both caused by ADHD's ability to focus deeply on passionate interests.
  A thread on the difference. (1/ðŸ§µ) ([View Highlight](https://twitter.com/StructuredSucc/status/1366070120519331840))

- Hyperfocusing is when we're intensely focused on an interesting task or piece of information. 
  How deep we focus during hyperfocus often keeps us from focusing on other things we should be doing, sometimes including eating, using the bathroom, or sleeping (2/6) ([View Highlight](https://twitter.com/StructuredSucc/status/1366070121941196805))
- Hyperfocus might feel like a surge of energy, or be so subtle we don't even notice, but usually we're drained after it's over.
  ADHD'ers especially notice how hard it is to focus on other things by comparison (though it's unclear if it's actually any harder than usual) (3/6) ([View Highlight](https://twitter.com/StructuredSucc/status/1366070123388313602))
- While hyperfocus can last from minutes or hours, hyperfixations last days or weeks.
  Hyperfixations aren't usually as deep or all-consuming as hyperfocus, however can have periods of hyperfocus within them (4/6) ([View Highlight](https://twitter.com/StructuredSucc/status/1366070124919226371))
- Hyperfixation is when we are intensely interested in a particular topic, project, or PERSON, for an extended period of time.
  To me, it feels like I am constantly being drawn back to my hyperfixation, and that it consumes all of my free time (5/6) ([View Highlight](https://twitter.com/StructuredSucc/status/1366070126202683394))
- ADHD'ers can (mostly) go about our normal lives while hyperfixating, but we may make impulsive decisions to give more time to our hyperfixation.
  After hyperfixation, we usually lose interest in the thing we were hyperfixating on, leading to our hall of incomplete projects. (6/6) ([View Highlight](https://twitter.com/StructuredSucc/status/1366070127246991360))
- Note: Hyperfixations are different AGAIN from autistic special interests, which can last weeks, months, years, or an entire lifetime (among other differences) ([View Highlight](https://twitter.com/StructuredSucc/status/1366070128295616514))
