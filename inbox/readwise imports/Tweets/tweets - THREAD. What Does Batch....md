- THREAD. What does "Batch Processing" look like, in practice? 
  In a recent blog post, I showed you different strategies not to "stay on top of the literature", but to "catch up with the literature" in a way that is gentle and still highlight inequities and challenges. ([View Highlight](https://twitter.com/raulpacheco/status/1365750120948588549))

- In about 2 weeks, I will be giving a guest lecture on polycentricity for a good friend of mine, Dr. Marcela Lopez-Vallejo at @udg_oficial for the @MrigyalUdg Masters. 
  I wanted to "catch up with the polycentricity literature". Now, this is a literature I have contributed to. ([View Highlight](https://twitter.com/raulpacheco/status/1365751356770963458))
- It's been a while since I've revisited this literature (Andreas Thiel, Liz Baldwin and I have a recent chapter on evolutionary institutional change and polycentric water governance). 
  So I decided to ask around for ideas - I got some great responses

- I decided to download 5 articles that I am sure will give me good pointers. Here is where my process starts.
  I downloaded all articles suggested to me by responders to my query. I put them in a separate folder, and then uploaded them to a folder on Mendeley. https://t.co/3XHH6ixp7X ([View Highlight](https://twitter.com/raulpacheco/status/1365752804854349825))
- If you've read my Paper Processing Protocol (PPP) https://t.co/aO2M5KdnZn or my previous blog post, you more or less know what's going to happen, right?
  - Print 5 articles (you can do this digitally though)
  - AIC - https://t.co/o5Z8pkLOI7
  - CSED row each. https://t.co/LuNbAcwzhX ([View Highlight](https://twitter.com/raulpacheco/status/1365754013187248129))
- This is what my empty CSED shell looks like. I still haven't printed all the 5 articles, but I already have the citations in place for when I read/skim them. 
  As you can see, I did everything as a batch process: download, organize, upload to Mendeley, copy cites to Excel Dump. https://t.co/VEKl3he75c ([View Highlight](https://twitter.com/raulpacheco/status/1365766371481706497))
- This is the printed batch of papers I would need to “Process”. 
  If you apply a daily #AICCSED you’d be caught up within a work week. 
  If you Process this Batch, you could devote 1-2 hours and get it over with. 
  How you read, annotate, take notes and systematize is your choice. https://t.co/FrjMt9QI8w ([View Highlight](https://twitter.com/raulpacheco/status/1365843675339751424))
