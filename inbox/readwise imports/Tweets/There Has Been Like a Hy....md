### Highlights first exported February 26, 2021 at 9:21 PM

- There has been like a hyper fixated/hyper-focused deep dive that has been going on since the middle of the week.
  That's also resurfaced like, the history of many defining moments in my life - some good, some bad. ([View Highlight](https://twitter.com/evan_just_evan/status/1365466415424278530))
    - **Note:** Save neurodiverse twitter tech twitter adhd at work and neurodiverse workflows how I used Obsidian at work how I use otter at work
- Which has lead to reading-rabbit holes, going over my own writing, journals, tweets - writing even more to organize the ideas.
  Then getting burnt out and emotionally exhausted, and then starting over. ([View Highlight](https://twitter.com/evan_just_evan/status/1365466416795770880))
- On one hand, I think I am getting a lot of stuff pulled together that I've been wanting to for a while and getting it organized.
  On the other hand, it's been hyper-fixated to the point of like, hard time sleeping, forgetting to eat - and when I do it's a cliff bar. ([View Highlight](https://twitter.com/evan_just_evan/status/1365466418075082754))
- But this is like hyper-fixation when it isn't cute super-power. ([View Highlight](https://twitter.com/evan_just_evan/status/1365466419522060292))
- yesterday was a mental health day, I had like info-dumped and then burnt out and needed head under pillow nap for a few hours. 
  The thought of trying to people was just a hard no.
  Did enough slack coordination to ensure a few things got done, and then sensory shutdown. https://t.co/6JkGgt6YPx ([View Highlight](https://twitter.com/evan_just_evan/status/1365470756516343808))
- Like, cozy blanket, head under pillows, faint sounds in the background. 
  Few hours later - get up, and then go into deep dive reading + self reflection hole until the mid afternoon. ([View Highlight](https://twitter.com/evan_just_evan/status/1365470757845946371))
- Initially, I had thought I might be able to get back online in the mid-afternoon or something, but the brain was like hard no - pass.
  Even the mental image of a notification was enough to be like NOOO, let alone actually seeing one. ([View Highlight](https://twitter.com/evan_just_evan/status/1365470758814814212))
- My brain was already fully saturated with the fixation, the idea of needing to people, and context switch, or make eye contact, or try to answer a question. 
  and it was like a physical reaction hard pass, nope. ([View Highlight](https://twitter.com/evan_just_evan/status/1365470759813013505))
- Like, it was the kind of headspace - where if I was working in an office, it'd be the:
  - "If someone makes eye contact with me, I think I might break"
  ... and then I'd usually hide all day, or leave, or go for a walk. ([View Highlight](https://twitter.com/evan_just_evan/status/1365470760811319296))
- Today is brain fog, starting to get back into some things - but it's like walking through mental sludge.
  Can get into something for a short bit. 
  But the moment that there isn't concentrated focus on something else - it's back to the fixation. ([View Highlight](https://twitter.com/evan_just_evan/status/1365470761817956356))
- and there was like one good solid hour of concentration, and then blurp. ([View Highlight](https://twitter.com/evan_just_evan/status/1365470762765844480))
- The first question was what did I do yesterday.
  I ‚ù§Ô∏è 
  ü§ñ the good jobüéâ 
  at the end.
  I actually really like geekbot, and these updated goto a public channel.
  Now, let's diverge into neurodiverse workflows and accommodations. https://t.co/D1lkqmHyVR ([View Highlight](https://twitter.com/evan_just_evan/status/1365472753424416772))
- Even with geekbot, we still have a quick zoom standup in the mornings except on Friday.
  The geekbot updates captures things in text, can have links to other things - so written record.
  It can help then free up the meeting time to not just be status updates. ([View Highlight](https://twitter.com/evan_just_evan/status/1365478590742220807))
- I'll also copy the responses 
  - into Notion, 
  - and then into my own personal note system (using Obsidian now).
  Usually the formatting is off and I'll spend some time cleaning it up.
  But, this also helps ensure that i'm actually reading the updates. ([View Highlight](https://twitter.com/evan_just_evan/status/1365478592507953154))
- When editing them in notion, I'll add other context 
  - I'll add links to other things. 
  - If someone mentions like the last retro - I'll mention that page.
  - I'll copy a link to the slack thread 
  But I'll spend a few minutes connecting it to other things. ([View Highlight](https://twitter.com/evan_just_evan/status/1365478593598529539))
- I can do this even if I'm not able to work that day, I can still quickly catch up.
  During the meeting if I am there, I will usually have otter running for auto transcription, but also taking my own point form notes. ([View Highlight](https://twitter.com/evan_just_evan/status/1365478594508644354))
- At times I'll add links / screenshots / etc to it as it goes along.
  But also - if I'm having bad brain day, being able to read along with the transcript, go back to it later if needed.
  I can be like fly on the wall doing my own thing but half paying attention ([View Highlight](https://twitter.com/evan_just_evan/status/1365478595397828609))
- And can still contribute, and / or go back to it later.
  Sometimes I'll put alot of time into cleaning up the transcript - adding line breaks, screen shots, links, fixing spelling.
  Other times I don't at all, or very little. ([View Highlight](https://twitter.com/evan_just_evan/status/1365478596362518530))
- As I'm editing - I'm also hearing the conversation played back.
  So it's like I get to ask someone to repeat themselves as much as I'd like.
  The mix of editing, highlights - if people mention a ticket or a document or basically anything I can link to. ([View Highlight](https://twitter.com/evan_just_evan/status/1365478597314625536))
- I'll find them - and add them as comments within the transcript.
  If they mention some pull request I might add:
  - link to the pr 
  - link to the tickets for it 
  - have a screenshot of the code 
  - link to a slack conversation we had about it. ([View Highlight](https://twitter.com/evan_just_evan/status/1365478598283583488))
- I'll also take screenshots - even if it's being recorded.
  It's capturing a useful moment out of a meeting and putting it into context with the transcript.
  I'll then copy key things into my work notes - and start adding backlinks / etc to build up my note taking system. ([View Highlight](https://twitter.com/evan_just_evan/status/1365478599319572481))
- If a meeting was recorded and I wasn't there, I'll usually download the video - upload it to get transcribed, and then read through the notes and edit them that way. ([View Highlight](https://twitter.com/evan_just_evan/status/1365478600317763587))
- There are some parts of this I can automate / template out.
  But also having a bit of friction in the right places gets me to engage with information in a way that really helps with memory / recall / context. ([View Highlight](https://twitter.com/evan_just_evan/status/1365478601307660293))
- By adapting more asynchronous communication, other ways of collaboration beyond meetings, having transcripts and / or recordings
  - helps me be able to manage my sensory needs at work. ([View Highlight](https://twitter.com/evan_just_evan/status/1365478602293321729))
- Like I document everything, but also have ways of summarizing over time and cleaning up as needed.
  At times I might not bother with any of the clean up until I need to go back to that note for something. ([View Highlight](https://twitter.com/evan_just_evan/status/1365482530665824256))
- So lots of my notes read like wall of text train of thought, and copy / pasting blocks from the transcript.
  Then if I'm asked about something - I'll find the recent notes where I wrote about it, clean them up and start to pull things together. ([View Highlight](https://twitter.com/evan_just_evan/status/1365482532100317184))
- The constant light weight editing over time, helps resurface ideas, build context and association.
  But I can be like: oh yeah Bob slacked me about X during this meeting 
  And I'll have that in my notes, along with a link to the slack message ([View Highlight](https://twitter.com/evan_just_evan/status/1365482533580795904))
- And probably also copy the slack message into my notes.
  I can then link them to my other notes, pull in related information - and see it in context with what else is going on. ([View Highlight](https://twitter.com/evan_just_evan/status/1365482534788878337))
- I'll tend to tag my notes with year / quarter / week 
  So it's really easy to basically query my notes to be like 
  "what was going on about X on week 9".
  And when those also link back to a transcript, I might clean it up then now that I might want to verify something. ([View Highlight](https://twitter.com/evan_just_evan/status/1365482535795449857))
