- TERFs are copying the Army of God, the far-right anti-abortion group that inspired a string of murders, kidnappings, and bombings against abortion-healthcare providers, by publishing the locations of trans-healthcare providers.
  This is what stochastic terrorism looks like. https://t.co/aapKeBOC2g

- 2/ The far-right has long used the ostensible defense of children as justification for their hate crimes.
  In the 1980s through the 2000s, it was the defense of "unborn children" by committing a campaign of terror against abortion-services providers.
- 3/ The alt-right brought with it PizzaGate and the "pedophile rings" conspiracies that define QAnon, as well as attacks on Drag Queen Story Hour.
  And now the TERFs-- who have been long-circling the far-right-- are bringing that same violence to trans-healthcare providers.
- 4/ TERFs have adopted the same free-speech/victim rhetoric, harassment tactics, targets, and even online platforms as Nazis.
  A *lot* of us have been saying this for a long time-- TERFS are just Nazis in pearls.
  Treat them like it.
