- Just tried something for my end-of-week summary notes.
  Used @obsdmd 
  - made use of the panes to have my per-day daily log above my weekly working notes
  - an end of week summary note at the top that was me writing bullet form
  - pane below that anything I clicked on opened into ([View Highlight](https://twitter.com/evan_just_evan/status/1362926012699443204)) ^dc08fve
    - **Note:** obsidian work workflow
- - Also used https://t.co/tnNqc5u4SH - I was talking out loud while reviewing all of my notes
  - My notes in Obsidian also link into Notion / Google Docs / Slack / etc - so they also act as an entry point into other apps / context / information. ([View Highlight](https://twitter.com/evan_just_evan/status/1362926013546721286))
- - have a nice outline of overall themes from the week
  - observations / feedback / trends
  - picking up on todo items / follow up tasks that I forgot about
  - at times something would spark an idea / memory - and I'd just infodump and https://t.co/tnNqc5u4SH would capture it ([View Highlight](https://twitter.com/evan_just_evan/status/1362926014423302145))
- - I have a bunch of notes that are like 
  - "blah blah blah, tk check otter" 
  - It actually feels like I remember the week now 
  I take a lot of notes during the week, and also usually use https://t.co/tnNqc5u4SH to transcribe them as well ([View Highlight](https://twitter.com/evan_just_evan/status/1362926015266369536))
- So I have an abundance of information, but at times that can be hard to sort through. 
  But - I now have a high level summary of the key points, 
  links back to the initial notes.
  I can flesh out the bullet points later if I want, 
  and keep the context of the other stuff also. ([View Highlight](https://twitter.com/evan_just_evan/status/1362926016101048320))
- and I was able to have headphones on, so could listen to music, dance around, take breaks, etc. 
  a good way to wrap up the week will try again. ([View Highlight](https://twitter.com/evan_just_evan/status/1362926247987273735))
- if interested, can show the layout/setup I had (but with fake data).
  But, reviewing notes from the entire week and doing a summary + catching follows ups I had forgotten about, was actually enjoyable. ([View Highlight](https://twitter.com/evan_just_evan/status/1362926626867150853))
