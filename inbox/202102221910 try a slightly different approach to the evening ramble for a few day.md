I might try a slightly different approach to the evening ramble for a few days. 

As I'm poking around my graph, experimenting with 

- graph view
- tags
	- nested tags
- including / excluding pages

everything is currently 1 or 2 steps away from connecting to a daily page - and the [[202102221914 Backlink Noise makes it difficult to connect ideas in interesting ways|backlink noise makes it difficult]] to follow the train of interesting ideas

So might break off into sub-notes a little bit more often and sooner and see how that works for a bit.
