It's hard to tell what's sensory overload, anxiety, is there depression - all of the above.

Something I'm thinking on is the differences between like

- Professional / Career burnout
- [[202103091722 -  Researching Autistic Burnout]]
- shutdown mode / meltdown mode
- how often in the past has what I thought was a depression episode - more a shutdown?

From the outside they can look very similar 

- retreat 
- speak less
- self care starts to drop
- withdraw from people
- previously simple things become hard

It reminds me a bit of the time when I was recovering from the burnout at Rangle, and was starting to do well on getting back onto my feet - and my therapist suggested an anti-depressant for me, and it turned into a quick 'no'

I've had success with it in the past, but this time it just set me back - as I have had issues with depression in the past, and it helped then.

But thinking if this was more of an [[autistic burnout]] scenario - different things going on in my brain, so what would have worked for depression might not work for that.

Once I told him what was going on, quickly got off of it.
