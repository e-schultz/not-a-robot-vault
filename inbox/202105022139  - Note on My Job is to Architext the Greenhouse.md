###### Note
[[I should]] go back and re-read this section more. Often when I've talked about [[my approach to]] being a manager, and trying to build and support culture - I've used metaphors of being a gardner.

I remember after my talk with [[Sam Rabar]] and going on my walk, I was thinking more about this - and think lost somewhere in my iOS notes that I should import - talking about how I think I need to think about a higher level than being the gardner, but there is also like the person that designs the gardene, and the support around it - and the idea of [[architect the greenhouse]] feels like it falls in line with this.

This was said by [[Tony Hsieh]] in the section [[The Architect of the Greenhouse]]
