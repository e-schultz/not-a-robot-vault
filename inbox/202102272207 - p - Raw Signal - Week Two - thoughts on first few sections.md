Was doing some more of the Raw Signal Blueprint training, this week is focused on one on ones - the what and why, the how, etc. 

Some of it's new - a lot of it is a refresher, or - putting a new perspective onto things that I've already been doing.

I think I've also been managed by people that have done this training before, a few phrases / terms / etc are cropping up that sound familiar. 

That's not a bad thing.

Some things that came to mind was 

- coaching vs mentoring, and knowing when to use which
- if I leave a one on one with more action items on my plate
- career pathing - career ladder vs career path --- reminded me a bit of the [[Why a Career Jungle Gym Is Better Than a Career Ladder]] thing as well, but accounting for the fact that people need to take their own paths, and having a rung by rung ladder isn't for everyone
	- can be useful in really early careers, but not as effective for intermediate / senior 
- spacing on what exactly now, but they are in my work notes, but a few was a
	- reminder of things that I used to do, but have stopped / got lazy on - and should start again
	- things that I have been doing, but being able to sort of group it mentally into a new bucket 
- "the managers toolkit" 
	- in my old note system, actually had one setup pretty well with meeting templates, question banks, some reminders of when to do certain things -> need to flesh out that workflow in obsidian a bit more
		- reminds me of the developer microskills news letter on [Reducing the Pain of Context Switching](https://ckarchive.com/b/5quvh7h2zvd4) when julien is talking about automating the right parts - [^julienDeveloperMicroskillsReducing2021]
