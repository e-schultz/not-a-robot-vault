##### Initial Reading Notes

## Burnout and Expectations
- [Burnout and Expectations](http://www.autisticscholar.com/burnout-and-expectations/) [^dwyerBurnoutExpectations2019]


> This accumulated fatigue not only leaves people tired and struggling to find motivation to complete basic tasks, but it has spiralling consequences across many areas of life.  Mental health can decline;[2](http://www.autisticscholar.com/burnout-and-expectations/#easy-footnote-bottom-2-830) anxieties can worsen; ==sensory sensitivities can become more severe==.  Tasks that would once have become easy become difficult.[3](http://www.autisticscholar.com/burnout-and-expectations/#easy-footnote-bottom-3-830)  [h.is](https://hyp.is/1LOT3IEvEeujKiejBwRibw/www.autisticscholar.com/burnout-and-expectations/)

Sensory issues have been getting worse, eg)

- hitting '4pm eyes fuck you' more often again
- moved my home office into my bedroom to reduce light

> We should instead set high expectations for autistic and neurodivergent people to reach their own personal potential in areas like academic achievement, employment, and autonomy and independence.  Within the “zone of proximal development,” the area of development just beyond a person’s current ability, the area that challenges us to learn but doesn’t overwhelm us, we need to allow autistic people opportunities to learn new skills and to make our own choices.[4](http://www.autisticscholar.com/burnout-and-expectations/#easy-footnote-bottom-4-830) Wherever that area might be.

### Surface Masking vs Deep Masking
referred to as camouflaging in the article

> This is most true of of “surface camouflaging,” which relies heavily on conscious effort and sheer willpower.  “Deep camouflaging,” which is based on [practicing social skills until they become automatic](http://www.autisticscholar.com/social-skills-practice/), may not be quite so exhausting as surface camouflaging, but even a deep camouflager will probably find social interaction more tiring and stressful than most neurotypicals.[](http://www.autisticscholar.com/burnout-and-expectations/#easy-footnote-1-830)
