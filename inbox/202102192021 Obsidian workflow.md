#### Workflow TL;DR
Been using [[Obsidian]] for work also recently, and still figuring out the workflow I want for it.

Was doing a weekly review - and got into a good flow that I actually enjoyed.

[[Just Tried Something For...|tweeted a bit about]] the workflow I was using for obsidian for work.

Something I want to expand on later.
