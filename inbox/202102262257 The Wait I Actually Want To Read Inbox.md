###### Initial Rough Notes / Outline

Instapaper also acts a bit as my "wait no, I actually want to read this one" inbox.

Where Refind can be very much my catch-all, Instapaper tends to be the "I actually want to read this one"

Often in the morning, if I'm trying to avoid doom-scrolling on twitter, I'll see what's in my Instapaper that I haven't read yet, and start reading those.

## Instapaper 

Instapaper on the phone also slows down my reading and writing a bit, but this can be a good thing at times. 

When I highlight, I also like to add a short comment to why I'm highlighting it (although I don't always), but the comment helps explain why I found it ueful at that time, and/or - knowing that these highlights get imported into Readwise, I might leave myself notes or reminders along with the highlight that I know will pop up again for me at some other time.
