# Exploring my notes

Sitting here with the desktop app open on one monitor, and the published version on the other - and it's an interesting way to explore my own notes. ^0fefe6

I find that sometimes, at least with my current setup I need to go out of my way to get related stuff to show up - explicitly open the back links, etc. 

I guess it's also a bit of the difference between 

- reading mode vs writing mode
- writing mode
	- personal
	- creative
	- editing


## Changing how I take notes is changing how I work 

But, digging around reminded me of when I said [[I don't trust my brain, but I trust my notes]], and also recently when talking about having ADHD at work - I said that one of the best things I've done for myself recently is change how I approach taking notes.
