So, been a bit since I've written in here - shutdown mode has been hitting hard, and been more than one day during work where I've needed to log-off early or miss part of a meeting due to [[sensory processing]] issues. 

But, today was the first day in a few days where it felt like my brain could brain - yay.

Been at my laptop kinda non-stop from 8:30am or so with minimal breaks, so - going to step away for a few before doing anymore writing and give myself a bit of a rest.
