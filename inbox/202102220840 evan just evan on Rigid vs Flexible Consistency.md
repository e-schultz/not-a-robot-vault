- So - quick thought on [[rigid consistently]] vs [[flexible consistency]]
  - recently I've started to get back into writing in my journal daily in the morning and having my [[The Morning Pages]]
  - also been enjoying the [[evening ramble]]
- (Can you tell I plan on copy-pasting this thread into my notes?)
  - But - this morning, haven't gotten around to writing my morning pages yet - and, I might not get around to it.
- If I was stuck in the [[Rigid Consistency]] mindset - I might be
  - ðŸ˜“ - Oh no, I broke the chain - I should be doing this very day. You only build habits by doing them daily, don't break the chain.
- I then get hard on myself
  - And even if the habit is serving me well, or I'm getting the same value but in a different way - I might end up tossing the baby out with the bath water - and take even longer to get back to it.
- With [[flexible consistency]] - I can accept that breaks may happen, that trying to force myself through can cause more set backs than progress.
  - It also allows me to think [[what is the value I get from a habi]] - and am I getting that another way?
- Some of [[the value I get from the morning pages]]
  - getting my head thinking
  - organization of mental clutter
  - bit of a brain dump
  - tends to surface stuff that's on my mind but maybe have been ignoring
- A few of the [[tweet threads]] I did this morning is a bit of that [[organization of mental clutter]]
  - Some of the value I get out of writing in my morning pages I've gotten from tweet threads, organizing a few videos I've made recently, etc.
- And since I tend to copy-paste these types of threads onto my notes anyways - [[using backlinks]] starts to connect them to my other notes pretty quickly.
- So much [[NT productivity advice]] is basically - have you tried being neurotypical?
  - And it does not apply, or at least in the same way for #neurodiverse people, and it can be frustrating when it's implied that we just need to [[try trying]] a little bit harder
