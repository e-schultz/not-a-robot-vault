### Questions
- I forgot about the term cognitive architecture - how does this relate to scanning patterns, if at all?


#### üó®Ô∏è Cognitive Architecture 

[[Cognitive Architecture]]

We have been talking about mental models as if they were real things, but what actually goes on in a learner‚Äôs brain when they‚Äôre learning? The short answer is that we don‚Äôt know; the longer answer is that we know a lot more than we used to. This chapter will dig a little deeper into what brains do while they‚Äôre learning and how we can leverage that to design and deliver lessons more effectively.  
  
What‚Äôs Going On In There?

##### Notes

Roughly speaking, Cognitive Architecture is the process of moving things from short-term to long-term memory, how we receive visual / verbal inputs, how that gets encoded for long term memory, and then retrieved.
