# Cognitive Load

![[Cognitive Architecture#^b9046b]]

- [[intrinsic load]] - is what people have to keep in mind in order to absorb new material.
- [[germane load]] - is anything that distracts from learning.
- [[extraneous load]] - is the (desirable) mental effort required to link new information to old, which is one of the things that distinguishes learning from memorization.
