# am I working towards my goals?
- [[what are my goals]]?
- [[am I spending energy in the right places]]?
- [[am I working with my brain, or against my brain]]?
- [[am I actually ok, or trying to convince myself that I'm ok]]?


Before the [[202102241819 Trying to unfuck DEI|unfuck DEI]] seed got planted, felt like I was starting to do pretty good, but I know at times the "energetic" version of myself, can be a bit of a warning flag, but not sure if it was in this case. 

But, maybe.

Was the crash inevitable? or was it just accelerated? - %% [[autistic burnout]] %%
