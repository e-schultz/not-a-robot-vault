#### üó®Ô∏è Choosing To Work On The Shiny Object
> **People assume that the cool shiny thing will get them visibility, have the resources it needs, or be reputable to put on the resume. ==But none of that matters if your manager doesn't give you the space to work well==, or your team isn't the right team to solve that problem.** You still have to evaluate all the components rather than take them as givens **_==otherwise you overestimate the value of working on something shiny vs. what you actually need in order to grow your caree==r._**



> ‚ÄúWhen I shifted from running all of central marketing for Uber to "Innovation" I was so excited to work on Autonomous Cars and Uber Elevate (flying cars). 
> 
> While those projects gave me unique insight, it was actually my work on Uber Freight and Driver Education that was both more satisfying and rewarding. 
> 
> As a growth person, **==having actionable customer needs vs. prospective customer needs meant my skills were more applicable to the problems both were facing at that moment==. So my impact was significantly more measurable and tangible to both myself and the teams I worked with**.‚Äù - Adam Grenier (Reforge Parnter, ex-Uber, HotelTonight)

##### Notes

- Working on the shiny new thing doesn't always give the visibility you expect
- Working on them doesn't matter if you don't have support from your manager 
	- connect to üîå - [[Building Not A Robot MoC]] - the role of manager / leadership support to enable growth and learning opportunities. 
- What are the consequences/impact of working on the shiny thing, but it doesn't have value?
	- Can over estimate how useful working on that is, vs what you need to grow. 
		- How can managers help?
		- How can a L&D department help?
		- Where does learning ecosystems fit in with this?
