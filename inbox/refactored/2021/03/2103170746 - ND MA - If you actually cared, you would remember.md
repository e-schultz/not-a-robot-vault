# [[neurodiverse microaggressions]] - If you actually cared, you would remember

Especially if I couldn't remember on the spot, and had to jog my own memory a bit to get back to the detail.

Coming to a better understanding of this, has also played a role in how I approach note-taking, and building out my own personal knowledge management system / second brain / whatever.

This is a process of building a system to help me with recall, and has been really useful at work.
