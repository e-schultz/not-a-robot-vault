# Woe's of the twitter tech grifter

[[Tech Twitter]] can be an interesting place at times, and last year I started to get annoyed with the 

- hustle-culture, 
- engagement bait 
- toxic-positively 

That a lot of the big tech twitter accounts tended to focus on, eventually I started to unfollow most of them, mute some, block others. 

But, there is another side of tech twitter that I've found, and actually enjoy engaging with - people that care about people, talk about things beyond "just tech"

So, when one of the accounts tweeted on the weekend

%%
Tech Twitter is... dying?! I see a huge drop in activity and engagement compared to this time in 2020. Any idea why is that? People got bored of tech? OR people got bored of creators?

- Places burden onto others
- Gets defensive
- Starts to attack people he had claimed to be wanting to support
- Plays the victim
- Starts deleting tweets that were problematic.

all I feel like writing about this right now, but does remind me that something I've been wanting to write more on is the toxic-positively side of tech culture, and how I kinda hate it.

# Wuz did a better summary
