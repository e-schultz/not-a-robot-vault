# New Laptop Day

Have a new 16" MacBook Pro today that arrived from work - physical escape key! the keyboard feels a little nicer also, although I use my mechanical keyboard when at my work laptop most often. 

I remember when I first started working, and if I got a new computer - it would be a multi-day process to get everything up and running. This was when I was working at Procom, .NET, Visual Studio, MSDN, installing SQL Server, and so many other things. 

It was still exciting to have a new computer to setup, but took so long to get up and running again. 

These days - the time to get up and running is so much faster.

- few of my `.dotfiles` I store on github - although, not as much as I could
- many of the applications I use are browser based 
- getting homebrew, node, vs code, python, etc up and running tends to be pretty easily

and, since I don't do as much programming these days, the main apps / tools I use in my workday are

## Main Tools:
- [[Obsidian]] - personal work notes
- [[Notion]] - collaborative / team notes
- [[Otter.ai]] - transcription of notes
- GMail / GCalendar / etc 

## Other Collab Tools
- [[Miro]]
- [[Figma]] 

## Because I have to:
- [[Zoom]]
- [[Slack]]
- [[JIRA]]

## Misc Others:
- [[Hypothes.is]]
- [[Grammerly]]
- [[Refind]]
- [[Alfred]]
- [[Geekbot]]
- [[1Password]]

Been noticing that recently my work laptop has been running slow, even after rebooting / shutting down proccesses / etc, so - looking forward to having this setup.
