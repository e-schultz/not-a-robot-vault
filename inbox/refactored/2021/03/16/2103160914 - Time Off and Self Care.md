# Time Off and Self Care

Finally booked some time off, and have next week off of work. Weather is supposed to be nice, not sure what I'll do yet, but the break is needed.

I think I'm nearing my 'maximum input threshold' - and trying to think about making plans during my time off is like 'nawh, can figure that out later',  the idea of making plans and logistics makes my brain hurt just a little.
