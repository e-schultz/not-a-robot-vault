# Few Sensory Crashes
- [[202102212320 Isolation has me wondering what was anxiety vs sensory processing issues]]

I think yesterday I hit a [[autistic burnout|sensory burnout]] point. 
- After Sprint Planning - my brain just went and rebooted 
- Perked up enough for some one on ones in the afternoon 
- but then crashed again

Something about trying to run the JIRA board while in a meeting just makes my head hurt.

When I was resting, it was like - no sound, not watching anything, just my brain was in "[[202103162118  computer says no mode|computer says no]]" mode.
