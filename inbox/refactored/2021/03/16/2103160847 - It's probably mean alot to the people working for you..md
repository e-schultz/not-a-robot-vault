# It's probably mean alot to the people working for you.

## Sticking to my own rules 

Part of me wants to go and spend time putting this note over into the tweet-threads section of [[@evan_just_evan]] - but that can break a bit of the flow of writing, and especially when the purpose of the ramble, is to well - ramble.

# Fear of the Blank Page

One of the biggest challenges I can have when I want to write about something, is having a blank page - I might know I want to write about this or that, but if I open up a google doc, or some online CMS and have just a blank text-box looking back at me, it can be intimidating.

But, when writing is how you work - and not an afterthought to how you work,  a lot of the initial writing has already been done for you.

## [[üå± Make use of whats on the editing room floor]]

A mistake that I've done in the past, especially if I've gotten over the fear of the blank page - is as I'm preparing to write something, I'll take all sorts of rough notes. 

I'll collect extra resources, write down way more information than what makes it into the final copy, and I might go explore rabbit holes on other topics along the way. 

Then, I make my final copy, hit save, publish it somewhere - and then all of those [[working notes]] get tossed away - and never used again. 

Once we learn to keep those around, treat them as living things - tweak and edit, connect to other ideas, grow them over time - they can become the source for other material over time.

## Leveling The Playing Field for Different Neurotypes

via [[@MissAmyTobey]] - [tweet](https://twitter.com/MissAmyTobey/status/1357475385177378816)

> high autonomy culture levels the playing field for different neurotypes. some folks can produce on a schedule. some folks (me) build stuff in fits, starts, and tsunamis. some are great at thinking on their feet, others need solitude and quiet. we need everyone [^1ma]

## Elise Kumar got me thinking about it.

[[Neurodiverse Twitter]]does get me self reflecting a lot, but nothing wrong with that.

## Alternatives to Clean Code 

Uncle Bob is problematic, and it's pretty common that his books Clean Code, and Clean Architecture get recommended, so it's time to [[202102231843 Stop inviting the racist uncle to your book club|stop inviting the racist uncle to your bookclub]]




## My Dislike of WebForms is why I learned JavaScript

@davidfowl [tweeted](https://twitter.com/davidfowl/status/1357464354048921602) about what was your programming language journey, and it reminded me of mine.

- I hated the UpdatePanel / partial page updates on WebForms so much, it was a big motivator to start learning JavaScript.

- and once I figured out how to expose methods as 'Page Methods' or whatever they called them, and make AJAX requests to it for things where I did need information from the server.
  - 'making ASP WebForms not suck" was my main motivation.
- it served me well.

# Was going to write a thing

.... but then I forgot, 

Oh - I think it was something along the lines of, need to consider the different ways that people appreciate recognition.

recognition can mean different things for different people - both in what it means to them, and how they want / recognized when it's being delivered.

Also - being aware of what types of behavior gets people noticed, and the biases it may inform. 

People can contribute in so many ways, but if you only reward and promote those that are very extroverted - you are excluding entire groups of people.
