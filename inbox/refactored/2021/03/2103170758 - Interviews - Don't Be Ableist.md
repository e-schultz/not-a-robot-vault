##### 

When I've been thinking about DEI recently, I've noticed a lack of information around [[neurodiversity]] and disability in general, and find that abelist can find it's way into the interview, feedback, performance management aspects as well.
[[Abelism]] - [[abelism at work]]

# [[Interviewing]] - Don't Be Ableist
- [[Abelism]]
I've also written about [[the difficulties of adjusting to remote work while Neurodiverse]] quite a bit, some of those notes are not collected into here (yet)

But I also have lots of tweets about [[202103172004 my experience having a stutter]], how it's impacted work, about how ND people are impacted by remote work - both good and bad.

Interviews can be particularly challenging for ND people, and often - aspects of the remote video interview can just make things worse. 

For example, I have a stutter - and it can have a big impact on how I am perceived, and some of the issues with video make it worse.

### Did I stutter, or did Zoom Freeze?

If I had a dollar for every time someone has asked "you there? did zoom freeze" - when I was stuck on a word, I'd be rich.

> Zoom didn't freeze - I have a stutter.

There are days when I am totally fluent, and it doesn't take much effort - and have no problem talking.

Then there are days, that are just bad mouth days. I get tongue tied, and can't even say my name to the Barista taking my name for my coffee order.

[[Irionally - my own name is a sound I consistently get stuck on]], which can make introductions pretty awkward at times, but I digress.

During interviews now - regardless of which side of the table I'm on - I'll usually comment that I have a stutter, and occasionally get stuck on words. 

#### Breaking the Tension

And also say - If there is something that you didn't understand - feel free to ask me to repeat it, I don't mind.

As at times with my speech impediment - I can also cluster words, repeat sounds - and yeah, at times when listening to my own voice back, I have no idea what I said either.

There have been enough times in my life, where I've seen the discomfort in someones face as they wait for me to force out a sound, or the look of confusion when it comes out in a mess that they can't understand.

I'd really prefer that they just ask me to repeat myself, but also - once this is out of the way, it's also a bit easier to leverage on some of the techniques that I use to manage my speech. 

### I'm not unknowledgeable or lying, I have a stutter 

Some of the common things that I've heard people look for, to try and see if someone is lying, or if they are taking a wild guess at answering a question - are some of the same things I do because I stutter.

I might have a long pause before starting to answer.

I know what I want to say, I know how I want to say it - but for some reason, the words just won't come out. 

Or, I know that there are certain sounds in how I would answer it that might give me a problem, so I'm re-arranging sentences in my head into ones that hopefully I won't stutter on.

I might get partway through a sentence and then get stuck on a word, and then sort of need to do a rewind and re-start - some people read this repeating of words, as reaching for words because I'm not really sure.

At times I'll touch my forehead to think for a moment, and that hesitation and delay helps me get into a response. 

- Sometimes that's read as me being thoughtful
- Sometimes that's read as me trying to come up with a lie

Eye contact is also uncomfortable for me - I might not always be making eye contact. 

There also times where if I'm getting stuck on something, I'll end up just literally saying "blah blahb blergg", and do some sort of vocal / mental reset and start over.

If I'm having a bad mouth day during an interview, ouf. 

But, at the same time - I've done allot of [[+ My Public Speaking]] and really enjoy it. 

When I've had the opportunity to travel to Barcelona to speak about [[How to create Vuetiful Data-Driven User Interface - JSCamp 2018]],  but I could still totally have an off day during an interview.

I'm also ADHD - and might fidget a bit, eye contact can get uncomfortable at times - and with the slight lag / video quality / quirks of video calls - reading expressions is taking so much more effort. 

Zoom has been a kind of neurodiverse sensory hell for me, and when slight pauses get read as zoom freezing - bleh.

I think I'm starting to loose my point here, but that's kind of the point of the ramble actually.
