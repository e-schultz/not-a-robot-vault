# Learning Maturity Matters Reading Notes
- Corner Stone - Learning Maturity Matters - Learning Management Survey 

## [[Learning Maturity Rubric]]

### Administrative
- No/Manual Systems
- No Commitment 
- Not Reported Consistently

#### Details

> This stage is foundational to all other stages; it suggests that learning is part of an ad-hoc process. Some evidence of this stage would be no structured reporting on learning, ad hoc training with no direction, and no consistent cadence

### Operational
-  Isolated Compliance-Centric System
-  Transactional Commitment
-   Reported as a Cost

#### Details 

> In this stage, learning is very functional with consistent processes administering learning, ==reported as cost. No intrinsic value in the learning itself; it is viewed as a necessary element and managed by cost containment==. Evidence of this level includes learning as a compliance solution, many organizations we work with fall into this stage

### Emergent
- Connected Performance-Centric System
-  Commitment to Performance
-   Reported as a Part of a Larger Strategy

#### Details

> At this stage, organizations start to get more out of learning beyond the basics of compliance. ==Learning goes beyond the transaction of “complete” or “incomplete” and seeks to transform the business by using learning to improve employee performance. The evidence at this level is that learning is found in daily workflows== and ==reported as a strategy for enablement==. However, it usually is embedded into some other initiative, such as an HR or enablement program

### Optimized
- Connected Development-Centric System
- Commitment to Development
-  Reported as a Separate Strategy

#### Details
> A true learning organization with a strong learning culture. That is what organizations at the optimization level have created. ==Here learning is a deep part of the company’s overarching strategy and viewed as a competitive advantage and keystone to building adaptability and resilience==. We consider organizations who fall within this stage as achieving a strong learning culture exhibited by treating learning reporting as important as financial reporting. ==Learning is considered a tool to increase employee satisfaction, retention, and personal well-being and growth. Organizations that do this typically have learning and development as a stand-alone entity entrenched in the business==
