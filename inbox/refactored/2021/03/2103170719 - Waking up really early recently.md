# Waking up really early recently

Time change does that I suppose, but yesterday I was up before 5, today was up at around 4:00am or so.

Lazed about in bed a little, and then actually showered, did a timmie's run - and then a quick walk around the park across the place from my condo.

Now that it's starting to get a bit warmer out, it's not as much mental gymnastics to throw on a light coat and get out for a quick walk, so that's been nice to start doing more often.

On the way in from my walk, picked up my new work laptop from the concierge
