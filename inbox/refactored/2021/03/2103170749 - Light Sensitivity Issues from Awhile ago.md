# [[Light Sensitivity]] Issues from Awhile ago

These are back from around  [[2020-10-30|October 2020]]

> Ugh, I can't wait for my new glasses to arrive. I almost forgot what it felt like to read without strain until during my eye exam, and was "what, clear text, without effort - what sorcery is this?" - [@e_p82](https://twitter.com/e_p82/status/1322289302169149441)

Later on in the thread,

> Been more than once recently if I've had a back to back meeting - that I've needed to cancel the 2nd one, because partway through the first one my vision is just like "peace out, c'ya" even writing this tweet is rather blurry right now for me - [@e_p82](https://twitter.com/e_p82/status/1322289304585031680)

At least that feeling of ==feel like I've already spent 90% of my energy for the day before saying "Good Morning"== [^ep1] hasn't been as bad recently, although still happens now and then.

Some of this is part getting my self care routine back into a better shape, but then also needing to keep an eye on burn-out.
