###### Initial Rough Notes / Outline

I've used a lot of different note taking tools / productivity apps, some because I had to for work, some out of interest. But, there is a distinction between the two main groups of tools that I use.

- Personal Knowledge Stack
- Tools I use for Work

There is some overlap between them, and they do benefit each-other. 

One of the main goals of my note taking system, is being able to assist with recall - and do it in a contextual way that makes sense for me.

There is also a difference between

- Personal Notes and Knowledge Management
- Collaborative Notes and Knowledge Management

# Personal Knowledge Stack

- Otter
- Readwise
- Instapaper
- https://web.hypothes.is/
- Zotero
- Refind 
- Obsidian 

These are tools that I would continue to use, even if I didn't need them for work. They serve a few different needs.

- Capturing sources of information - basically my reading inbox
- keeping track of which ones I've read and found useful
- Notes on the things that I am reading
- Resurfacing old notes / highlights
- Build context around a topic

## The Catch All Inbox

I tend to use Refind as my catch all inbox, it serves a few roles

- my bookmark manager 
- my web reading inbox of maybe
- content discovery
- content curation
- and starting to keep track of what I've read

If I see something that I think might be interesting, I usually save it to Refind. 

### The Library
- [refind/evan-schultz](https://refind.com/evan-schultz)

This is a large list of things that I thought "hey, may be useful", and this page isn't including things that are on my reading list, but haven't been grouped into a public collection yet.

Even if things are in the public public collection, it doesn't necessarily mean that I've read it yet. It means 

> "'I've skimmed it enough to know what bucket to put it in"

And usually have passed some sort of quality sniff test, but there are alot of things in there that I haven't read yet.

#### The Actually Read

Recently this month, I created a collection called [2021 February Reads](https://refind.com/evan-schultz/2021---february-reads), of which I've added most of the content that I've actually read this month.

It's not a "Best of February", and it's not even necessarily a "New in February", or even "New to me in February"

## Highlights and Notes
- Readwise
- Hypothes
- Instapaper

I tend to take a lot of notes when I'm reading an article, especially if it's one that I find interesting.

Usually if I'm reading an article, and I think it might be useful to make a few notes on it. I'll either

- Save it to Instapaper 
- Highlight it with Hypothes

Often if I'm on my phone - I'll save it to Instapaper, then read it in Instapaper and highlight / make notes there.

## The Wait I Actually Want To Read Inbox

Instapaper also acts a bit as my "[[202102262257 The Wait I Actually Want To Read Inbox|wait no, I actually want to read this one" inbox.]]

Where Refind can be very much my catch-all, Instapaper tends to be the "I actually want to read this one"
