###### Initial Notes

### Hybrid Async + Video Standups

Even with geekbot, we still have a quick zoom standup in the mornings except on Friday.

The geekbot updates captures things in text, can have links to other things - so written record.

It can help then free up the meeting time to not just be status updates.I'll also copy the responses 

- into Notion, 
- and then into my own personal note system (using Obsidian now).
