exposing blind spots
poke me in the eye and collect the tears
so we can learn for a better tomorrow.

We can't eliminate harm, and stepping in the blind spots hurts - it's how we learn, and react -- and work for harm reduction.

When someone points out that you did a bad thing, especially if you thought you did a good thing - that can suuuck. 

[[that discomfort you're feeling - is something to work with, not avoid]]. 

When we place your comfort, above the safety  of others - you are causing harm.
