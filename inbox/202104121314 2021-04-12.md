Well, it was meant to start out as a vacation - as I've been writing about for awhile, I have been circling around Burnout at work, and looking back at things - it had started months ago. 

On my first week of vacation, it was very much

- sleep
- walk
- sleep

The idea of trying to plan to do anything was hard, and then on the Friday - I finally had enough space to recognize just how tired I was.

I then sent an email to HR, and talked about getting a second week off, and eventually turning into a: "I think it's time for me to leave PartnerStack"

Then, last Monday - made it official, made my announcement in slack, and signed off on the papers - and well, now officially unemployed.

I don't have a solid plan - yet, but I do have an idea that I have been chewing on for awhile, and plan on using this time to refine it a bit more, and then maybe start my own thing.

As I've said before, at least to myself - It's time to build my own sandbox to play in.

I have some initial notes/thoughts over in [[Building Not A Robot MOC]],

I also have a bit of a [brain dump over in Notion](https://www.notion.so/xCAAS-Braindump-eeef8de0db454f8594d26b02d2f3e083) - might move some of those notes over to here, or maybe the other way around, not sure yet. 

Working in Obsidian is very quick for getting out ideas, fleshing them out, etc - but not always the most usable by other people.

On the other hand, I do like the linked database / projected views / etc in Notion - and while I can emulate a little bit of that in Obsidian right now, can't really do it while in 'edit mode', *shrug*
