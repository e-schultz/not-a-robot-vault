Every time I start a new vault, library, or using a note taking app / knowledge management system - there is a part of me that wants to do a bulk import of everything that I have written before. 

And considering how much stuff I have scattered around - it is, alot - especially when I have been using apps like

- [[Readwise]]
- [[Instapaper]]
-  having things synced with [[Goodreads]], 
-  [[Notion]]
   
etc ---- I have an abundance of content that I could just bulk import all at once.

But, I think I shall resist that urge - and let this grow a bit more organically over time, and since I do have lots of stuff written in other places - and can find it pretty easily, pull it over as it makes sense. ^0010d9
