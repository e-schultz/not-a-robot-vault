# [[2021-04-16|ðŸ“…]] Morning Pages

Ah good morning Evan, and the morning pages - been awhile since I've done a morning pages kind of format.

All around, it's been a good week - and it's been nice to have **brain space** to just exist. 

Getting through the day doesn't feel like I'm playing a game of wipeout with my sensory input, where I'm rushing through the day to make it through a cruel obstacle course.
