- Not sure if this is imposter syndrome, or #neurodiverse thing, or both.
  - For the longest time, I was convinced that I wasn't smart - that I was just faking it really well, and somehow would get exposed for being a complete idiot. ^8ab21f
  - Like, I'm pretty daft.
- In Grade 3,
  - I had a teacher try to put me into special ed - I had a bad stutter, couldn't read out loud, she liked to yell at me - not a great mix.
  - So I remember doing a test to see if I should goto special ed
- Apparently not,
  - Then shortly after - I was taking a test to see if I should be going into the gifted/enriched program.
  - Apparently, I bombed it the first time on purpose because I didn't want to change schools.
  - Then I did it again, did fine - but stayed at my school
- (that part is a bit fuzzy in my memory, but it's how my mom tells it)
  - My grades were usually a few things I did very well in, and then a bunch of stuff with low grades.
  - It was either like B+ or with no effort, or a D's / fails - when I was putting in so much effort.
- "You could do good if you only applied yourself"
  - *gestures to the few good grades as proof of me applying myself*
  - "You could do good if you only tried"
  - "You have so much potential"
- While being dismissive of the things that I was good at.
  - It made me not trust in the things that I was good at.
  - There were some subjects that just clicked with me, and I excelled at without much effort compared to other classes
- Then there were subjects that I liked, or wanted to like - and tried really hard at.
  - Sometimes I ended up doing well.
  - Often they would be my worse grades.
- So I kind of got it in my head, that being smart was
  - doing well at hard things
  - but have a hard time at doing well
  - If that makes sense.
  - Like, if something was easy for me - I didn't trust I was actually good at it, because it wasn't hard.
- And even as an adult now, I know that there are certain types of work that I can excel in, and certain ways that I work that can really leverage how I think.
  - But, I still find myself falling into the
  - "If I tried just a little harder at X, then I would be better at it" trap.
- I do enjoy hard things and new challenges - but sometimes not so great at identifying when the challenge is, is it challenging:
  - Because my brain just doesn't work that way
  - Because it's a hard problem - that is a good match for how I work.
