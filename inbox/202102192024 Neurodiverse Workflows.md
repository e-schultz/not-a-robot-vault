#### TL;DR

So, after I was writing [[202102192021 Obsidian workflow#Workflow TL DR]] - it got me thinking about building out neurodiverse friendly workflows.

There have been a few things pop up on twitter about neurodiversity and work.

But this workflow that I'm figuring out - feels like it plays to both my strengths, while providing supports where I need it.

The mix of audio + text recordings, linked notes, back links, able to quickly jump into slack and other areas and build context.

In a recent one on one I had explained a bit about how changing my approach to notes has been one of the best things I've done for myself recently. 

It's about building systems that help with recall and context, and in ways that evolve over time to meet your needs.
