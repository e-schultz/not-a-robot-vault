# Building Learning Hubs

At work, I'm building up a learning hub and resource library - and during a 1:1 got talking about [[ðŸŒ±- my first real program]], and how collecting, curating, and building systems / processes to gather and share information is something that I've always enjoyed doing.

Note taking, knowledge management - both personal, and collaborative/team, etc are all kind of special interests of mine.
