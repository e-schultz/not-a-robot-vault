The first week of video's have been ok, and curious to see what the live session will be like this week.

First week has covered a bit of

- What is Management
- Organization Design
- Goals and Alignment 

It's also gotten me thinking about how the organizational structure of Rangle and PartnerStack are different, and also how the structure of "old Rangle" vs the structure of "new Rangle"

I started at Rangle when it was still really small, I was employee 30 - and was a part of helping it grow and scale to just under 300. 

I learned a lot from it, and a lot of what they touch on so far kind of helps me better understand where some of the challenges came from in terms scaling and having clarity. 

## Improving Smart Goals
I also liked how they redefined SMART Goals.

- Significant instead of Specific
- Agreed instead of Attainable
- Realistic instead of Relevant

As they explain[[202102212040 RS - Their take on improving SMART GOALS|their take on SMART goals]] - going into the significance of those differences.
