# [[Good Morning Evan, how are you doing this morning]]?

Not too bad, woke up kind of early, killed some time on twitter, flipped through some of my Readwise review - and now getting ready to start my day.

Lacking of groceries + cold outside = breakfast delivery, ... I know, I know - I need to get real food soon, even my body is starting to dislike me.
