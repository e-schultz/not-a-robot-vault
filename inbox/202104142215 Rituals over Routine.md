# Ritual over Routine
#Ritual over Routine - Rituals allow for some improvisation if needed, making due with what you have. 

When I think of routine - I tend to get a rather rigid mental image of what one is, and then how to go about it. 

#Lichtenbergianism

routines tend to imply conformity, an prescribe the doing of the thing, and not the thing to be done.

if something needing to do the thing according to the routine isn't there, then we might not do it - instead of being creative in still getting it done.

Rituals however? 

Can be as flexible, or as precise as you need them to be. 
Can adapt depending on the environment, what is available 
- or maybe trying something new. 

Rituals involve the act of doing the thing, and not just the thing itself.

So even if the ritual fails, you get something out of it. Rituals, and the rhythm of them can also encode more meaning than simply the steps to the ritual itself. Routines - do x, do y, do z, but why?

> Same applies to principles based practices. Version control, build systems, and CI for principles. Git, rollup, and circle as practices. Principles last longer than practices - [@mhartington[https://twitter.com/mhartington/status/1382508169956626432]

I was thinking about how people try and then compose routines into procedure and workflows/practices. Principles last longer than practices - I like that.
