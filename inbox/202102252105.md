## MyPronouns.org 

Some quotes from MyPronouns.org - https://www.mypronouns.org/

> Often, people make assumptions about the gender of another person based on the person’s appearance or name. 
>
> These assumptions aren’t always correct, and __the act of making an assumption (even if correct) sends a potentially harmful message__ -- that people have to look a certain way to demonstrate the gender that they are or are not.

> Using someone’s correct personal pronouns is a way to respect them

> Just as it can be offensive or even harassing to make up a nickname for someone and call them that nickname against their will, __it can be offensive or harassing to guess at someone’s pronouns and refer to them using those pronouns if that is not how that person wants to be known__.

> Or, worse, actively choosing to ignore the pronouns someone has stated that they go by could imply the oppressive notion that intersex, transgender, non-binary, and gender nonconforming people do not or should not exist.

### Why Gender Pronouns Matter

- [Why Gender Pronouns Matter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9iKHjl5xAaA&feature=emb_title)

Some quotes that stand out from this one for me:

> “when someone misgenders me, especially if it’s from someone close to me - it’s like a knife in the heart”

> “It’s not a preference, it’s who they are”
