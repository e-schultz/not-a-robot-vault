For example, an entry I might have in my work notes might look like:

# Example Note

### meeting prep 
- notes to myself 
- how did I feel going into the meeting?
	- rushed
- how do you think the meeting went
	- it was ok, I wish I had more time to prepare for it

### Meeting Notes
- the notes

# Linking it to other stuff

For shared notes, I might copy/paste into notion - or, if notion was the source of truth, I might copy and paste it into my own personal notes. 

I can the mark it up, link it to other things, and in a way that makes sense to me.
