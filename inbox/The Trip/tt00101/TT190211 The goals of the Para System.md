> This system would have to be:
>
> -   **universal**, encompassing any conceivable kind of information from any source
> -   **flexible**, able to work with any project or activity you take on, now and in the future
> -   **simple**, not requiring any time-consuming maintenance, cataloguing, tagging, or reorganizing beyond a bare minimum
> -   **actionable**, integrating seamlessly with task management and project management methods
> -   **cross-platform**, able to be used with any application, now existing or yet to be developed
> -   **outcome-oriented**, structuring information in a way that supports the delivery of valuable work
> -   **modular**, allowing different levels of detail to be hidden or revealed, depending on the needs of the current task
> -   **opportunistic**, in the good sense, taking advantage of work already being performed, instead of requiring dedicated overhead time - [[@fortePARAMethodUniversal2017]]
