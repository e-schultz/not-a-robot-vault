# 2021-02-19 - The Trip

Going to try something different for this nights note.  Not going to link to this from anywhere yet, and instead of doing a a really long ramble like I've done in the ramble, break things out into smaller chunks as I go along. 

As I'm trying to get a little bit more organized, was looking into the PARA system again, and was wondering - [[TT190210 Whats my PARA|Whats my PARA]], but before that - a bit of a recap on [[TT190214 Whats para TLDR|Whats a PARA TL;DR]]

Enough about notes and areas of responsibility for now, [[TT190223 really enjoyed thaty luigi tozzi set| really enjoyed thaty luigi tozzi set]]  while getting on with my night. 

So, [[TT19022a5 what's next on my mind for this inaugural session|what's next on my mind for this inaugural session]]
