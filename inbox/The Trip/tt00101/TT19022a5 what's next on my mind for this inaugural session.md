Some of the things I've been wanting to look back on and think on,

- how has my self care routine been going
- [[TT200214Â this week feels like it went well|this week feels like it went well]]
	- yay - enjoy
	- but what also how/ why?
	- this kind of relates to an earlier tweet where I was talking about [[TT190249 how I started to accept ADHD as a disability,|how I started to accept ADHD as a disability, and how that changed my perspective on things]].
