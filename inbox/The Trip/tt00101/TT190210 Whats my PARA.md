![[TT190227 Para Definitions Diagram]]

- Projects
-	a series of tasks linked to a goal with a deadline 
- Areas
	- area of responsibility, a sphere of activity with a standard to be maintained over time
- Resource
	- a topic or theme of ongoing interest
- Archive
	- inactive items from the other 3 categories
