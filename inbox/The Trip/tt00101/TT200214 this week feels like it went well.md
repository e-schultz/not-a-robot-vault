this week feels like it went well, and I should totally enjoy that.

But, it's not without it's downsides - and some things that I want to consider

- a little too heavy reliance on timmies for breakfast 
- starting to establish routines to start and end my day
- started to meditate again, and been enjoying calm
- some aspects of self care have gone up
- some aspects have gone down
- but the overall trend is upward
- also, starting to use [[TT190245 psychedelics more often is probably one of the best things I've done for my mental health during the pandemic|psychedelics more often is probably one of the best things I've done for my mental health during the pandemic]], but more on that later.

But even though some aspects around diet and food were not there, [[TT190237Â there was building up some good foundation in other areas.|there was building up some good foundation in other areas]].
