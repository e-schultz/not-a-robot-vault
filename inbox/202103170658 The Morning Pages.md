Good Morning, on The Playlist this AM as I jog my memory for a morning pages for the first time in awhile, currently listening to [[MNMT Recordings  PijÃ£r - Anecumene 9128.live]]

# The Good Work Day Trend

Was going through some other notes, and saw this from the 10th.

and was also feeling the same way last night.

So huzzah for Progress I suppose. 

Although last Friday - was a total write off day for me, as was most of the weekend. 

A trend that I do need to be mindful of, is the

- burnout / shutdown day
- followed by hyper-productive day(s)
- trying to keep up with that pace
- then burning myself out again

So even though yesterday was a 'good work day', I was also kind of at my desk non-stop from early in the morning until early afternoon, and didn't really take many breaks, or even eat lunch.

Not good in the long run.
