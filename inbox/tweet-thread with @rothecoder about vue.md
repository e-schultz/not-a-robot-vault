# Getting a sense of interest in content of Vue for X Developers

[[@rothecoder]] was tweeting about how they have been learning [[VueJS]] since their new job is using it, which reminded me of something I've been wanting to do for awhile - and create some Vue content.

### Background 

Something that has been on my mind for awhile, is creating content around "[[Vue for React Developers]]", or "[[Vue for Angular Developers]]", there seems to be some steam behind Vue picking up in Toronto, and a number of the bootcamps that I'm aware of - tend to have a stronger focus on React.

[[Vue shares quite a bit in common with React and Angular]], and knowing one or the other can ease some of the learning curve of adopting Vue,  and I think there could be a demand for some content around this.
