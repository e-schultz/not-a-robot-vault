- mandatory
	- especially for HR / compliance training 
- It's boring, passive and outdated
	- active vs passive, 'netflix of learning', L&D teams being bottle necks, not levering SME's
- It's punitive
	- PIP plans, trying to "fix weaknesses", possibly ones identified in performance reviews 
- Training dolled out as a reward
	- "only the good employees can go"
		- who is left out?
		- who is included?
		- how does this relate to DEI?
- Outcomes are not always clear
