I had some thoughts on this.

> I'd be inclined to follow-up and give a second chance - don't want to accidentally cut out [#neurodiverse](https://twitter.com/hashtag/neurodiverse?src=hashtag_click) [#ADHD](https://twitter.com/hashtag/ADHD?src=hashtag_click) [#Autistic](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Autistic?src=hashtag_click) people from the process where Hyperfocus, time blindness, etc can be a real challenge.

> I'd give a second chance - ADHD / Hyperfocus / etc can be a real challenge, especially if undiagnosed / untreated. In University before I was diagnosed - I'd forget exams now and then. It sucks - but an instant dismissal could be cutting off [#neurodiverse](https://twitter.com/hashtag/neurodiverse?src=hashtag_click) candidates [^je2]

> Many people are not comfortable being open about this at work - even afternoon hired. It's something that I wouldn't be surprised if most people wouldn't want to mention during the interview process. [^je3]

> There are alot of people in the [#neurodiverse](https://twitter.com/hashtag/neurodiverse?src=hashtag_click) community on Twitter that don't want to use thier real names, out of concerns of thier employeers finding out and having negative consequences. [^je4]
