I've been at, seen enough times where a culture of learning was boasted, but wasn't able to scale - or be followed through on.

Then, what usually ends up happening is something along the lines of

- a learning allowance, maybe a conference budget (when those were a thing)
- maybe get recommended a few online courses 
- maybe work towards getting a certification 

And, it feels like it becomes more of this passive thing, that we "consume, if we have time - then carry on with whatever we were doing before, and forget what we just learned"

#### If they are trying to do a bit better

Maybe they will have a career ladder, a road-map - and try to get you training on things to work towards a goal, and basically try to re-create a a kind of traditional academic model into the work place.


##### Also a very neurotypical approach

#tk - but I just have issues with the education system, when companies want to try and take [[learning and development]] seriously, they are trying to model a system that I hate, find ablest and discriminatory.
