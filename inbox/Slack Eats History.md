# Slack Eats History

###### initial brain dump
- [[2021-05-06]] - [[Slack]]
- I used to really enjoy using slack, but recently - I've been finding it increasingly frustrating to use.
- The way slack eats history - making it hard to find old threads / etc 
- notification noise
- channel overload 
- 'everything is urgent'
- handles real-time chat well, but sometimes you need async conversation 
- some of the ways I've managed this
	- linking to slack in my own notes
		- 'meta-pages' to surface things from slack
	- trying to get team norms for emoji's
	- threads - but I find that there are issues with threads
		- wish I could 'quote-tweet' into a new thread at times
	- It's become the 'connect all' for so many different applications to feed into - "ChatOps", that it can get in the way of clear communication for other areas
- "slack catchup" when recovering from a sensory shutdown, could then become a trigger of information overload
	- slack notification anxiety
