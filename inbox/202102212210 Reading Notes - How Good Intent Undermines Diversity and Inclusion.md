Skimming through the article by Analee - I've read this before, and think I have some notes on it. But, going to pull out a few of the sub-headings for now.

> But asking people to “assume good intent” will actually undermine your code of conduct and make marginalized people feel less welcome and less safe in your community. - [h.](https://hyp.is/-msuVmgGEeufdHMO-ozDYg/thebias.com/2017/09/26/how-good-intent-undermines-diversity-and-inclusion/)

> Telling people to “assume good intent” sends a message about whose feelings you plan to center when an issue arises in your community. [h.](https://hyp.is/HNFGEGgHEeuigC_199KNPQ/thebias.com/2017/09/26/how-good-intent-undermines-diversity-and-inclusion/)

> A positive rule is still a rule, and it still bans behavior that contradicts it. You need to think carefully about what behaviors your positive expectations are banning, and who those bans will affect. “Assume good intent” is a particularly pernicious positive expectation that will undermine your code of conduct. The implied inverse of this is that _not_ assuming good intent is against the rules.

### Codes of Conduct Address Systemic Inequities

> As a community leader, you don’t want to build spaces where people react calmly to getting their foot stepped on for the millionth time. You want to build spaces where people can trust that they are safe from being stepped on. [h.](https://hyp.is/bBnJkGgHEeunEscbuxQ0mg/thebias.com/2017/09/26/how-good-intent-undermines-diversity-and-inclusion/)


###  The False Equivalence of Treating Harassment as Interpersonal Conflict

>  Addressing incidents as if they’re simple conflicts between the parties involved sets up a false equivalence between dealing with discrimination and dealing with the momentary discomfort of being told you hurt someone. [h.](https://thebias.com/2017/09/26/how-good-intent-undermines-diversity-and-inclusion/)


###  Invalidating Victims’ Feelings

> Worrying about ‘assuming good intent’ when one party has harmed another is centering the feelings of the person who behaved badly, and expecting the person they hurt to center their feelings, too. [h.](https://hyp.is/HPOE_mgIEeuu6IsfBs8Wfg/thebias.com/2017/09/26/how-good-intent-undermines-diversity-and-inclusion/)


- This ties into understanding that harassment and conflict are different things, and that there is also a difference between hurt feelings and harm.
- When real harm is caused - asking me to be understanding of your hurt feelings, continues the cycle of harm. 
- Being put into a position of being expected to accept an insincere apology - or being labeled as the difficult one if you don't - #tk 

> Telling people to ‘assume good intent’ is telling them that no matter how badly they hurt, they still need to smile and be nice so the person who hurt them won’t feel blamed. [h.](https://hyp.is/u2YCQmgIEeuPa-dyka1SeQ/thebias.com/2017/09/26/how-good-intent-undermines-diversity-and-inclusion/)

This one hits home, and goes back a bit to what I talked about in [[The Harm in Insincere Compliments]] - so often I was told to play with the bully. 

### Policing Victims’ Reactions

> Including “assume good intent” in your code of conduct tells victims that they aren’t safe in your space, because if they do anything to make others feel bad about harming them, they will be held accountable for breaking the rules. [h.](https://hyp.is/AsEBPGgJEeu34Ee_OzEaFA/thebias.com/2017/09/26/how-good-intent-undermines-diversity-and-inclusion/)


### Questioning Victims’ Perceptions

> Marginalized people already know that we’re supposed to “assume good intent” in others. We are told every day that we’re “paranoid,” “overreacting,” or just plain “crazy” if we don’t feel good about being treated badly. This process is called ‘gaslighting,’ and it’s a way of making marginalized people distrust our own perceptions so we won’t object to being mistreated. [h.](https://hyp.is/vnxvOGgJEeuUQq_tVLb9BQ/thebias.com/2017/09/26/how-good-intent-undermines-diversity-and-inclusion/)

>  Members of other marginalized groups develop similar forms of pattern recognition to protect themselves from harm, often based on signs so small they can’t consciously describe them. [h.](https://hyp.is/4XN4fmgJEeujA9_uo9WxtQ/thebias.com/2017/09/26/how-good-intent-undermines-diversity-and-inclusion/)

- We are used to being invited into places that we are told and safe are inclusive
	- and then being harmed in those spaces
		- often by people claiming to be allies
	- when we voice our concerns - we get dismissed, told we are sensitive 
	- we get told that it didn't happen that way 
	- then consider those who have been impacted but domestic abuse, narcissistic abuse and manipulation
		-   and also how that intersects with marginalized communities
			- and how that intersects with neurodiverse 
	- the amount of harm I have been on the receiving end because of 'assume good intentions', is too much.

> When you tell people in your community to “assume good intent,” you’re reinforcing the notion that marginalized people shouldn’t trust their instincts. [h.](https://hyp.is/ltXGpGgKEeuuvCfKeQhBKA/thebias.com/2017/09/26/how-good-intent-undermines-diversity-and-inclusion/)

> Culture-setting documents like your code of conduct and corporate values should be designed around protecting marginalized people from harmful behavior. Leave out “assume good intent.” Instead, create a culture that recognizes and pushes back against the ways that marginalized people are dehumanized. Expect people to demonstrate their good intent by treating people with respect. [h.](https://thebias.com/2017/09/26/how-good-intent-undermines-diversity-and-inclusion/)



###  Who Are You Protecting?

> But society at large is already inclined to assume good intent in people with power and privilege–even when they’re not demonstrating it. If you want to build a culture of “assuming good intent,” start by assuming good intent in marginalized people.
