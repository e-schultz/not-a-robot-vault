### Highlights / Notes

> [Microaggressions](http://www.bbc.com/capital/story/20180406-the-tiny-ways-youre-offensive---and-you-dont-even-know-it) are brief queries, comments or actions in day-to-day life that target marginalized groups. They are often not _intended_ to be malicious, but over time they can lead to a toxic work environment and can preclude feelings of [belonging](https://www.forbes.com/sites/rebekahbastian/2019/04/10/the-business-case-for-belonging/).

> A recent [study from McKinsey & Company](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/gender-equality/women-in-the-workplace-2018) shared that almost two-thirds of women experience microaggressions in the workplace, commonly in the form of needing to provide more evidence of their competence than me

> Black women reported an especially high rate of enduring unprofessional language, and lesbian women are the most likely to hear demeaning remarks. While less data exists on men of color, there is strong anecdotal evidence that black men experience microaggressions in the workplace as well, often being painted as aggressive or intimidating. All of these encounters add up; employees who experience microaggressions are three times more likely to regularly think about leaving their jobs.

#### Avoid Biases

> Unintentional microaggressions are usually the manifestation of unconscious biases, which are learned, automatic stereotypes that have the ability to affect our behavior. Most people do not believe that they are racist, sexist, ageist, heterosexist, etc., but their words and actions can surface biases that reflect discriminatory belief systems [h.](https://hyp.is/aWxCuGgMEeuZbXP4paCU6w/www.forbes.com/sites/rebekahbastian/2019/06/10/microaggressions-good-intent-is-not-good-enough/)

> -   If someone holds a bias that a given population is not articulate, they might “compliment” a person for being well spoken. [h.](https://hyp.is/mtl7BGgMEeu_b3OoDCOM_Q/www.forbes.com/sites/rebekahbastian/2019/06/10/microaggressions-good-intent-is-not-good-enough/) - [[Abelism]]

> -   If someone holds a bias that a given population is aggressive, they might give a person feedback that they are “intimidating,” while the same behaviors are considered “assertive” in another person. - [h.](https://hyp.is/t8ZvEGgMEeuchFenbk4RSw/www.forbes.com/sites/rebekahbastian/2019/06/10/microaggressions-good-intent-is-not-good-enough/)


### Repair Damages

> Even well-intentioned people who have done the work to uncover biases and try to avoid manifesting them can still mess up. [Research has shown](https://labs.psych.ucsb.edu/major/brenda/docs/Dover,%20Major,%20Kaiser%202016.pdf) that discussions of biases in diversity training can cause majority groups to become defensive, [h.](https://hyp.is/354uQmgMEeuEBtvy6CceXA/www.forbes.com/sites/rebekahbastian/2019/06/10/microaggressions-good-intent-is-not-good-enough/)

Oh, that research is available as a PDF -> [[S-  Members of high-status groups are threatened by pro-diversity organizational messages]]

> While a perpetrator of microaggressions might have not intended to hurt someone, the recipient might still feel deeply hurt, which has been shown to [lead to elevated levels of depression](https://www.centerforhealthjournalism.org/2017/11/08/how-racism-and-microaggressions-lead-worse-health).

> Good intentions are important, but the impacts of people’s actions are the true measure of goodness. By channeling intentions into learning about biases and the ways that they manifest into microaggressions, work relationships can be strengthened and harm to marginalized groups can be reduced.
