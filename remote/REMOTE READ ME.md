# REMOTE READ ME

I have more than one vault, in more than one repo.

I've been doing some of my readwise review notes in another vault, and I also have one for stuff around music.

I kind of want that information in here, but when I think of things that fall under the 'remote' folder 

- -> this vault is not the source of truth for it.
- -> any updates to that note, should happen in that vault/location
- -> I can write 'notes' on what is in there, but that will be a new note in this system

This is where using the Zettelkasten prefix ID helps, as the prefix is in the format of: `YYYYMMDDhhss` - the chances of me having the exact same ID on a note in any of my other vaults is minimal, once that ID is generated the first time that I create the note
