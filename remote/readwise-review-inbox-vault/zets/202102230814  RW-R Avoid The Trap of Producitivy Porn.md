> Because the principles of note-making encourage students to generate their own content and to design their own note-taking system, \_\_there is no one-size-fits-all note-making method\_\_. However, some popular methods check all the boxes of a solid note-making method. [^1]


I think this is where [[the trap of productivity porn]] can come in for some people.

They are looking for the perfect system, watch all sorts of videos and tutorials on how to be productive, and want a premade system for them.

Instead - it's personal, it grows and evolves over time - you shape it to your needs.

You can be influenced by other [[note-making systems]], try them out - see what works and what doesn't, and then make it your own.
