# Highlights 

###### HL:  This is a journey without end, it's a life long process

> We are offering an analysis and awareness tool in order to develop ourselves as critical and compassionate people. Dismantling racism, sexism, heterosexism, and unlearning oppressive attitudes will and does take a lifetime. Most of us have been struggling with these issues for years and years already. None of us are beginners and none of us have perfect clarity. This work is a journey without endpoint. ==This work is a lifelong process==. [^1]

**initial note** 

To begin understanding race equity work, the Dismantling Racism Works Book makes a number of [assumptions](https://www.dismantlingracism.org/assumptions.html).

Often, people want a quick fix or an easy-win, but do not realize that this is a life-long process, and developing an ongoing practice to challenge and re-educate ourselves. 

I was looking back at when I started to engage with this more, and talking more about it - and a bit of how I've started to learn along the way.
