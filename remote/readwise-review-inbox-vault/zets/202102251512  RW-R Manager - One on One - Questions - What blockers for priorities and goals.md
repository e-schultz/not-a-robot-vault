Often when discussing being blocked, delays, etc - people can feel defensive and like it is a matter of blame. 

One of the roles of a manager, is to help provide clarity, remove roadblocks / obstacles, and see if there are patterns that could also be impacting other people on the team, and working to address and solve them.
