#### HL: Leadership can be aware of problems, but not willing to act on them

> Dale remembers that once, a manager shushed her when she responded to a question she’d been asked directly during a meeting with him and another male colleague. He then asked her male counterpart to answer the question. 
> She says that when she went ==to HR to tell them about the behavior, nothing seemed to change==. “==Leadership at Mailchimp clearly knows about this and doesn’t do anything about it==,” she says. [^1]


##### Notes:

###### initial note:  
- being aware, but not caring, or not believing it's a problem [^h1]
- can lead to people not reporting if they feel nothing will be done

###### Ways that gender bias can appear
%% 2021-02-27 %%
- shushing someone, and then asking the male counterpart to answer instead is showing that they don't respect her opinion, or think she is less informed. 
	- A common pattern in bias is assuming that the man in the room is the correct one.
- It can be a common misconception of employees, that HR is there to help them - but their primary role is to protect the company.

#### HL: Penalties for not accepting inappropriate advances 

> Employees say the company’s ==position as one of the premier startups in Atlanta allows it to view workers as disposable==, as there are fewer tech jobs to choose from than if the company were located in San Francisco or New York City. 
> 
> They also say that because the organization is private and has never taken on outside investment, executives can operate without the specter of more public accountability. ==Many feel they’ve exhausted every option internally and are only speaking to the press as a last resort==. [^1]

##### Notes:
###### initial note:
"If you don't like it, just leave" is something I'll hear people say - being unaware that

- leaving may not be a valid option
- other opportunities may not be there
- just leaving allows the toxic culture to continue

#### HL: Penalties for not accepting inappropriate advances 

> After they returned to Atlanta, Oliver sent her a message saying he’d thought they were going to hook up on the trip. Luaces responded that she didn’t think it was a good idea. ==Shortly after, the offer to move to his team seemingly evaporated==. Luaces’ role was being eliminated in the reorg, and she was ==told she could either take a lower-level position or leave the company==. [^1]

##### Notes:

###### initial note:
power dynamic and imbalance - give into sexual advances, or be penalized for it - neither are appropriate.


#### HL:  Don't confuse metrics for goals

> One of the key metrics on the IT team was how many tickets agents solved. Mailchimp employees would write in with technical issues, and it was up to the team to resolve them as quickly as possible.

##### Notes:
###### initial note:
measure the wrong metrics for the wrong things - get results you don't want. 

Don't confuse metrics for goals
