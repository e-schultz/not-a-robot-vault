I think this also depends on if it's a good-faith argument, for example - the book Irreversible Damage: The Transgender Craze Seducing Our Daughters, by Abigail Shrier is not someone I want to interpret the attention as good on.

Jessie Earl does a good job at explaining the problems with this book in her video [The "Irreversible Damage" Of Transgender Puberty Blocker Legislation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvqGKNrLKZQ) [^jessie1]
