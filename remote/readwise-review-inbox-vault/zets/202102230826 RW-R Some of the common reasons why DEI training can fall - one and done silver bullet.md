Some of the common reasons why DEI training can fall - one and done silver bullet. 

I remember when a place I worked did a D&I training - once, and no one could remember when, or who went to it, or if we could do it again. 

It is not a silver bullet, it is not a one and done thing - and it needs to be a continued effort.
