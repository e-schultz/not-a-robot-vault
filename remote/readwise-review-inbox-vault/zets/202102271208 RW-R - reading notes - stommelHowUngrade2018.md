### Reading Notes 

#### Questions 

##### Q:  How can we create spaces for dialog for feedback instead of simply grading?
- [[202102271208 RW-R - reading notes - stommelHowUngrade2018#^525347]]

# Highlights 

#### HL: Creating a space for Dialog

> Their self-evaluations (which I sometimes call “process letters”), and my responses to them, become a space of dialogue. [^1]

#### initial note:

I really like the idea of this form of self-evaluation, I think people are so used to feedback being a one-way street and not a conversation.

From a young age, we are usually trained to have this "hand it in, get a grade, move on" type of mindset - instead of having a dialog, and how to improve.

This mindset can then carry over into the workplace - both in the expectations of how to receive feedback from managers, and how managers approach giving feedback - as some sort of quarterly grade and not much dialog in between. [^2]

#### HL:  Student self-evaluation vs Transactional Grading

> What students write to me in self-reflections and self-evaluations is profoundly different from the kinds of interactions we would have in a purely transactional system. [^1] 

##### initial note:

This reminds me of different ways of doing assessment, and the value of having a feedback loop instead of just getting a final grade, and no room for feedback or improvement. 

For me in school, it wasn't uncommon to get a final grade, on the final copy - and other than comments on say, spelling and grammar - if there was a bad grade, there was not a feedback loop. and a chance to improve it, as it was time to move onto the next lesson or top.
