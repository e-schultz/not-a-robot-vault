> At all stages of making notes, the keyword is: active engagement. Donâ€™t just ingurgitate whatever you are studying. Proactively use your own language and create your own systems. [^1]

[[active engagement]] is important - not only for note-making, but I think for learning in general.

This is why I can be critical of how some tech companies approach [[learning and development]], it places learning in the passive and as something to be consumed.
