> "...the mere consciousness of an engagement will sometimes worry a whole day." â€“ Charles Dickens


I like the idea of the consciousness of an engagement can worry a hole day [^1].

This this makes me think about is the times where if I have a flight booked at 6pm - just thinking about the flight can chew up the whole day. 

This reminds me a bit of [[202102230759 ADHD Waiting Mode and how it can ruin a day|ADHD waiting mode and how it can ruin a day]]

It's just better to get to the airport early and wait - and then I can kind of start being productive then

Or, if I know I have a meeting coming up soon - it can be hard to get engaged in a new task that I know will take some focus.

In theory - I could be doing some prep time for that meeting to go in prepared, but that assumes I know what to prep on, have the time to do so, and that the prep work doesn't need to be deep focused work either.
