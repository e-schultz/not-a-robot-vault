# Highlights 

###### HL:  New managers often feel unprepared to run team meetings

> We asked managers how prepared they felt to run team meetings, and 45.6% answered that they felt highly prepared (a 4 or 5). But when we asked how prepared they felt to run one-on-one meetings, only 24.4% responded with a 4 or 5. [^1]

**initial note**

I think that there is an assumption that everyone manages the same way. 

I've asked other managers before if they have talked with their people about things like: 

- explaining their management style 
- asking what kind of relationship do they want 
- how do they like to be managed 
- - etc 

and a lot of people say no. 

Management is more than just getting status updates and sending down priorities - but I think many people have only experienced that type of management, and keep on with that style without really thinking about it.
